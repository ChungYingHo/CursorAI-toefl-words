The Eiffel Tower-one of the most famous `landmarks` in the world— is reopening. COVID-19 was responsible for its longest closure since World War II, but everything won't be back to normal just yet. Tourists will have to `convince`  themselves that it's no pain, no gain to go up as CNN's Cyril Vanier is about to show us.

CYRIL VANIER, CNN CORRESPONDENT
During the worst days of the coronavirus crisis, Paris's Iron Lady still `played her part` with a simple message to healthcare workers from a grateful nation-thank you. The Eiffel Tower, visited by almost seven million tourists a year, shut down three months one week and four days ago.

I haven't been back to the Eiffel Tower in many years, and my first `impression`  is that the ground level right here is an `underrated` `vantage point` of the tower itself. Just look up. This feels pretty special.

The first level is a `reminder` that the Eiffel Tower experience is now COVID-19-`compatible` distancing, signage, face masks and hand gel are the new normal. The tower is keen to show it's even going a step further-`regularly` checking that surfaces are well and truly `disinfected`.

For now, the `lifts` are closed because of distancing rules, so if you want the view, well, you have to earn it. It's also more fun this way.

Seven hundred and forty-five steps to the second level-that's a 50-minute climb for an `estimated` four to five thousand visitors expected on day one.

This is the, for me, the best view that we can have in Paris. That's why it gives us a big emotion when you come just here.  Notre-Dame［聖母院］, the Louvre, the Sacré-Cour［聖心堂］, the Arc de Triomphe［凱旋門］-all there, if you know where to look. 

At the risk of sounding `cliché`, the view here truly is amazing. You feel like you're `floating` above the city, and you have a direct `line of sight` to all the landmarks.
