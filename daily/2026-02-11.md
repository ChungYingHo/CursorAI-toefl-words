Bathed in pure Australian sunshine, Sydney `Harbour`  glows in the first light of day.
It's the postcard-perfect star of Sydney, and it gives the city a `distinct` charm. This land, which is my homeland, is one of `laid-back` luxury where nature `dictates` daily life. This morning, the winds led me to a view that I never grow tired of, and it's just the beginning of a day that I know won't disappoint.

Just south of Sydney is Symbio Wildlife Park. They've `arranged` some special one-on-one time for me with a few of the country's `native` `species`. But to be `honest`, I really came here for one animal in `particular`.
Everyone from Oprah to Taylor Swift has made it a top `priority` to meet one of these in Australia. And with her videos getting more than one million views on Facebook, baby Imogen `captured` the world's attention when she was born.

Adventure is without `doubt` at the very heart of the Australian `spirit`, and I'm about to test mine at the world-famous Bondi Beach. There's nothing more `synonymous` with Sydney than surfing. Blonde and bronzed, hitting the waves here is pretty much a way of life, so it's `probably` about time that I gave it a go, too. And who better than six-time world `champion` Stephanie Gilmore to get me out on the water? She's the only surfer to ever win three `consecutive` world titles.

STEPHANIE GILMORE, PROFESSIONAL SURFER
To `paddle` into a wave and to take off and feel, like, the speed, and to feel like you're in a relationship with the ocean, to feel a bond with something that covers 70 percent of the earth is a truly `incredible` feeling and something that I think everyone should experience at least once in their life.

This is actually a lot more difficult than I thought it was gonna be.
As the `inevitable` darkness takes over Sydney, there's a `beacon` in the night calling me to my final `destination` of the day. It's probably the most `iconic` building in the world and it's certainly the most `recognizable` image of Australia. And while it's true that almost every tourist who comes to this city comes here, I'm gonna find a whole new way to do the Sydney Opera House.
Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, this UNESCO World `Heritage` Site houses seven performance `venues`, and perhaps the grandest of them all is the main concert hall.
Here, Bruce has arranged for us to have it just to ourselves.
And to stand on this stage is an incredible feeling as well, isn't it? To know all of the history behind it and the people who have stood on this stage, it's incredible. Just about everyone has been here at some point.
