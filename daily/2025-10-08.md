In the late 17th century, what'd become the city of New York had an estimated population of fewer than 8,000 people. Today, that population's more than eight million. It's the most populated city in America. That's not its only change. The island of Manhattan has grown vertically, of course, with skyscrapers but outwardly as well, as dirt and the garbage generated by all those people were used to expand the area they could live on. Today, we're joining a local architecture critic for a tour of New York City's ever-changing waterfront.

JUSTIN DAVIDSON
We generally think of New York as having five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island, but there's really a sixth borough-and it's the largest-which is the water that connects the other five.
So, the first pier in New York started right here. Standing here, you don't really feel like you're in a maritime city. You don't feel like you're close to the water. But in New Amsterdam days(新阿姆斯特丹時期), this was really the edge of Manhattan, and everything from here to what is now the river is landfill. It's really the most profitable kind of recycling, where you take garbage, put it in the water and turn it into real estate.

One of the best places to get a sense of how the city has changed and the waterfront has changed is right here: Pier 15. It's a wonderful example of the way a relatively small, relatively modest design intervention can create a space people really didn't know about. So, this is Soissons Landing. This is the entry point to Governors Island. If you take the ferry from Manhattan, it's just a five-minute ferry ride. Everybody disembarks here and then finds their ways to different points on the island.

And there's a map which shows you the two parts of the island: the original Governors Island, which is where the Dutch first settled, and then all of this is landfill.

I'm here in Brooklyn Bridge Park, which is a wonderful place to tell the story of New York's tempestuous love affair with the water and the waterfront. And right where we're standing, here, was just an oily, polluted shoreline isolated behind chain-link fences that you really couldn't access. It was only, kind of, an abandoned area of the city. Now, thanks to 20 years of landscaping and reclamation, this park is now full of people. It's a destination park, not just a neighborhood park.
To me, this story of New York reembracing its waterfront is a very optimistic one. It's not just about the waterfront; it's really about the idea of seeing some of the hardest-hit areas of the city, some of the weaknesses, and finding the imagination and the long-term commitment  to build something new.
