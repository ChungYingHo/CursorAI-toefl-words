The city of `Teotihuacán`, which lay about 50 kilometers northeast of `modern-day` Mexico City, began its growth by 200–100 B.C. At its height, between about A.D. 150 and 700, it probably had a population of more than 125,000 people and covered at least 20 square kilometers. It had over 2,000 apartment `compounds`, a great market, a large number of `industrial` workshops, an `administrative` center, a number of `massive` religious `edifices`, and a regular grid pattern of streets and buildings. Clearly, much planning and central control were `involve`d in the expansion and ordering of this great `metropolis`. Moreover, the city had economic and perhaps religious contacts with most parts of Mesoamerica.  

How did this `tremendous` development take place, and why did it happen in the Teotihuacán Valley? Among the main factors are Teotihuacán’s geographic location on a natural trade route to the south and east of the Valley of Mexico, the `obsidian` resources in the Teotihuacán Valley itself, and the valley’s potential for `extensive` `irrigation`. The `exact` role of other factors is much more difficult to `pinpoint`—`for instance`, Teotihuacán’s religious significance as a `shrine`, the historical situation in and around the Valley of Mexico toward the end of the first `millennium` B.C., the `ingenuity` and foresightedness of Teotihuacán’s elite, and, finally, the impact of natural disasters, such as the volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B.C.  

This last factor is at least `circumstantially` `implicate`d in Teotihuacán’s rise. Prior to 200 B.C., a number of relatively small centers `coexist`ed in and near the Valley of Mexico. Around this time, the largest of these centers, Cuicuilco, was seriously affected by a volcanic eruption, with much of its agricultural land covered by lava. With Cuicuilco eliminated as a potential `rival`, any one of a number of relatively modest towns might have emerged as a leading economic and political power in Central Mexico. The `archaeological` evidence clearly indicates, though, that Teotihuacán was the center that did arise as the predominant force in the area by the first century A.D.  

It seems likely that Teotihuacán’s natural resources—along with the city elite’s ability to recognize their potential—gave the city a competitive edge over its neighbors. The valley, like many other places in Mexican and Guatemalan highlands, was rich in `obsidian`. The hard volcanic stone was a resource that had been in great demand for many years, at least since the rise of the Olmecs, and it `apparently` remained in demand throughout pre-Columbian times. Teotihuacán `artisans` were widely distributed, providing the material from which tools and weapons were made.  

The city’s `artisans` may have been among the first in Mesoamerica to make `pottery` vessels on a potter’s wheel. They produced a great number of `ceramic` vessels and figurines, many of which were exported. Teotihuacán appears to have been the center of a powerful art style that spread throughout much of Mesoamerica. `Distinctive` Teotihuacán `pottery` and architecture have been found at many sites outside the valley.  

Another factor that may account for Teotihuacán’s importance is its role as a religious center. The city is dominated by two gigantic religious structures, the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon, as well as by the Temple of Quetzalcoatl, the Feathered Serpent. The city was a place of `pilgrimage` for the entire Valley of Mexico and probably for other parts of Mesoamerica as well.  

Finally, Teotihuacán seems to have developed an `urban` society of considerable complexity, one that was able to `sustain` a large population. Its apartment `compounds`, which housed the city’s inhabitants, were constructed of stone and were often two or three stories high. Many of these structures could accommodate 60 to 100 people, and some may have housed specialized groups of `artisans`. The apartment `compounds` were arranged in neighborhoods, and the city as a whole was laid out in a grid pattern. The high degree of planning evident in the city’s construction suggests a powerful central authority.
