Data from the world's leading hotel groups, travel `firms` and trend `forecasters` suggests that 2026 will be the year of quiet escapes, `algorithm`-shaped `itineraries`, ultra-personalised `retreats` and a return to slower, more intentional travel.

`Number crunchers`, `behaviouralists` and travel firms have been `compiling` their data over the last few months to assess where they think the travel industry is heading. 

From "coolcations" – a trend that emerged a few years ago to become one of the Collins Dictionary words of the year – to "flashpacking", a term used to `denote` `upscale` backpacking, annual travel trends tend to come with an `awkward` `portmanteau`-style word and almost always reflect how we live – or how we want to live.

We've `sifted` through the best of the year's travel predictions, made-up words and all. These are the top trends on the horizon for 2026.

**Quiet over everything**

One trend is set to dominate next year: "quietcations". Also called Hushpitality, this movement centres on comfort, silence and finding a way to escape the compounding stresses of modern life.

With our always-on digital culture `colliding` with an endless `rollcall` of global events reaching us in real time, it’s no surprise that many of us are `looking to disconnect`. Hector Hughes, co-founder of Unplugged, a series of digital `detox` cabins in the UK, has been watching the trend `take shape`.

"When we first started Unplugged in 2020, digital detoxing and `analogue` living was pretty much unheard of," he says. "Now, over half of our guests `cite` `burnout` and screen `fatigue` as their main motivation for booking."

The trend is showing up everywhere. Visit Skåne's Map of Quietude is a network of places ranked by `decibel` in the south of Sweden so you can seek out peace and quiet; while at Oregon's Skycave Retreats, guests stay for three days in cabins in complete darkness.

**Gen AI over admin**

We will `undoubtedly` see more AI woven into travel in 2026. According to Amadeus research, increasing numbers of travellers are already using generative AI for planning and booking.

With major players like Expedia and Booking.com `integrating` tools such as ChatGPT, it's becoming easier than ever for robots to plan your holiday for you. Add real-time translation and mobile digital check-ins, and technology is quietly removing much of the `admin` that used to define a trip.

But the rise of AI comes with complications. `Sustainability` experts warn that algorithmic recommendations can fuel overtourism, `funnelling` travellers to the same few destinations. It's also behind a growing number of travel `scams`, so it pays to be use these tools thoughtfully.   

Cultural trends specialist Jasmine Bina, CEO of Concept Bureau, says that Gen AI is shifting how our desires are expressed, but not why we travel `in the first place`.
