**MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT**  
Ten thousand feet up, surrounded by stunning beauty, we stand in one of the most restricted places on Earth. This is Tibet—a region the Chinese government rarely allows foreign journalists to see. For CNN, it's been 10 years since our last visit. Back then, tourists were just `trickle`ing in. Today, the `floodgate`s are opening.

This year, some 24 million tourists will come to the Tibetan `Autonomous` Region, though some question if the number can really be that high. By 2020, authorities expect `upwards of` 35 million, including foreigners, who still need a special entry `permit`. They'll stay in the dozens of hotels like this one— five stars, international brands. Not long ago, though, most Western companies `shun`ned this place.

But `controversy` aside, companies are lining up to come here as China's `economic` appeal keeps growing. We were invited here to `cover` an international tourism expo in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. It was a government-organized trip, where `minder`s followed us everywhere we went, determined to show a peaceful and happy Tibet: things like painting, dancing and opera. And then, there was construction—so much construction. 

"There are `infrastructure` needs that are being gradually constructed and improved" says Wang Songping, a tourism official. "We are building a world-class tourist destination—Rome was not built within a day." Since leaving Lhasa, we've been traveling on dirt roads like these for hours—for miles—but eventually that will change because of giant construction projects like that one right there. Eventually, that will become a modern highway, `stretch`ing for hundreds of miles. You can only imagine how much this remote part of Tibet—some 14,000 feet up—will change once it's finished.

This woman lives at the end of that new highway. She was the only Tibetan we were allowed to speak with— `handpick`ed by Chinese officials. She got `subsidy`ies to turn her home into an `inn` for tourists. There's even a picture of Chinese president Xi Jinping on her wall.  
Is she ever worried that part of the Tibetan culture is being lost here?  
Despite being surrounded by Chinese officials, she only offers an uneasy smile and says she's not sure. Critics say locals are being marginalized as the Chinese make money hand over fist, using Tibetan culture as a selling point.
