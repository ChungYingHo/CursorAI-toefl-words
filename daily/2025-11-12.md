"Until now, Okinawa has been the pride of the world as the island of longevity. However, now the health of the people is deteriorating," Miyaguni said.

Miyaguni explained that even after the islands were annexed, Ryukyuan folk cuisine was still governed by the Chinese philosophy of ishoku dogen, which emphasises the importance of using high-quality, seasonally available ingredients. Homemade tofu, mugwort soup, purple potato and bitter melon remained staples of folk cuisine, along with the Confucian belief of using all parts of the pig. "Everything but the oink," Miyaguni said.

Today, Miyaguni still keeps a book in her kitchen called Gozen Honzō (Edible Plants of Ryukyu), which was written by a chief physician to the king of the Ryukyuan Kingdom. "Gozen Honzō… explains the types of and used of edible plants, animals and many other foods and a number of sections describe methods of preparing them," Miyaguni said.

"We've lost the Ryukyuan language because it isn't taught, but understanding how our ancestors cooked, and teaching these traditions is how we will continue to protect the Ryukyuan culture for future generations," she added.

While Miyaguni's interest in preserving Ryukyuan cuisine stems from her medicinal background, Kazumi Kayo, a Ryukyuan cooking instructor and food culture ambassador for the Okinawa Prefecture, says her interest in reviving these culinary traditions goes back to her mother.

"When I was young, I was not interested in Ryukyuan cuisine," Kayo said. "However, the memory of the taste that my mother made for me since I was a child came back to me, and I wanted to maintain a cooking method that brought out the taste of these simple ingredients, so I specialised in cooking, obtained a qualification and started a cooking class."

But Kayo is aware that the region's famous longevity – which many believe is inextricably linked to its diet – is increasingly in peril.

"For a long time, Okinawa prefecture has maintained the world's longest life expectancy, but with the Westernisation of food, that ranking has dropped, and now the number of people suffering from lifestyle-related diseases is increasing, which is a problem for the prefecture," Kayo said.

In 2016, Okinawa's prefectural government developed a programme called Ryukyuan Cuisine Masters to help preserve Ryukyuan food while also addressing rising health concerns.

"About five years ago, we strengthened training for chefs in the food and beverage industry and nutrition associations, provided them with qualifications and started activities to pass on and popularise Ryukyuan cuisine, including traditional cooking methods," Kayo added. "I think the residents of the prefecture will realise the goodness of Ryukyuan cuisine again."
