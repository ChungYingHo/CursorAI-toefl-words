**The habit of drinking a glass of orange juice can have a `considerable` effect on your health.**

If you're anything like me, then your idea of breakfast heaven includes an ice-cold glass of freshly `squeezed` orange juice. The trouble is that this sweet `citrus` drink has been `demonised` for some time.

While oranges themselves are packed full of vitamins, in drink-form, experts warn that orange juice delivers a sudden rush of sugar to the blood. Over time, this daily sugar-spike could lead to `insulin resistance`, raising the risk of `diabetes`, heart disease and `obesity`.

Or so the thinking goes. Yet actually, research is starting to show that despite its high sugar content, a daily glass of orange juice could bring all manner of health benefits.

**Why we got orange juice wrong**
`To begin with`, cohort studies – which track tens of thousands of people over time – show that individuals who eat lots of citrus fruits are less likely to go on to suffer from heart disease and stroke.

However most of these large studies asked people about how much fruit they ate, not how much fruit juice they drank. Eating whole fruit can have a substantially different effect on the body compared with drinking fruit juice.

"First of all, it's the speed of eating," says Federica Amati, a nutrition scientist at Imperial College London, UK. Amati points out that if you eat two or three oranges – the average amount it takes to make a small glass of orange juice – "it's going to take you longer to eat them, chew them and `swallow` them".

She adds, "In fact, most people probably wouldn't want to eat two or three, as that's quite a lot of oranges. Whereas when you're drinking a small glass – in a couple of seconds it's gone."

Whole fruit is also rich in `fibre`, which feeds the good bacteria in your `gut`, and is linked to health benefits such as a reduced risk of `cardiovascular` disease and `colon cancer`. Fibre also slows down the flow of sugars into our bloodstream. Orange juice – and other fruit juices – are made by crushing and `pulping` whole fruits, which `strips` them of most of their fibre.

The end result is that if you compared a person's blood sugar response from eating a whole orange `versus` drinking a juice, the whole orange would result in a fairly gradual rise, whereas a glass of orange juice has a more dramatic effect.
