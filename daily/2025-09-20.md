TCNN NARRATOR  
Hanoi—the Vietnamese capital that lives on the street off cups of coffee and bowls of noodle soup.  
It's a city of seven and a half million whose `soundtrack` is the `din` of motorbikes with a sampling of French colonial architecture set against the driving beat of modern commerce. Along its many lakes and throughout its `maddening` network of alleys, you'll find the people of Hanoi who are writing the next chapter of this thousand-year-old town.  

BIEN NGUYEN, EDUCATOR  
Hanoi is quite an old city. You can see, like, a lot of different `layers` of history. You can see, with your eyes, the real history there. My full name is Nguyen Bien Thuy. I'm 33 years old, and I've been living in Hanoi for my whole life.  
Early in the morning, everyone is just sitting somewhere, reading the newspaper and drinking coffee. The people in Hanoi—they love coffee.  
So, Hanoi `Hideaway` was created by me and one of my friends. We came up with the idea because, `basically`, the coffee culture is quite popular. The coffee shops in Hanoi are not only about coffee. They're more about the culture and history, so you can really `explore` Hanoi through coffee shops. Here in Manzi, for example, you can see a lot of artworks on the wall, and they change every week or every month. The atmosphere is different because the artworks are different.  

Loading T is a really interesting place. The building is really, really beautiful. It was owned by a lawyer in the past, but then, after the war, the government took over. They divided the building into many different `chambers`. Loading T is really charming.  
Coffee shops are not, like, the only way to `explore` Hanoi, but it's an interesting and different way of approaching Hanoi's life.  

LINH PHAM, `PHOTOJOURNALIST`  
Photography, for me, is something really `spiritual`. My name is Linh Pham. I'm 26 years old, and I'm an `independent` `photojournalist` based in Hanoi, Vietnam.  
We decided to create this thing called Matca where we promote `documentary` photography. We focus on the ordinary. But people most of the time these days, they just forget about the ordinary.  
I want to take you guys to the Long Bien Bridge. It's just because it's a place that I'm really familiar with. It was built by the French more than 100 years ago. And it has been through, like, two wars, and it's still there. So, it's, like, a witness of our time, you know, of Hanoi. It has got that `historic` context plus that, you know, `dramatic` scene of the market under the bridge. To me, it's, like, something really, like, cinematic.  

My workflow is this: I love to revisit the same place so I get an `understanding` of that `particular` place, and with that understanding I can find the point of view or, like, the `element` that stands out. So, we're in front of Hanoi Opera House, one of the most `iconic` buildings in Hanoi, and today I'm invited to see the `rehearsal` of a show called Lang Toi, which means "My Village." And I heard that it's a mixture of, you know, the new `circus`, `contemporary` dance and with traditional Vietnamese music.  

The main idea of the show is to create a mood and `duplicate` scenes of the daily life in the countryside of Northern Vietnam. All the actors are Vietnamese, and all the dancers are Vietnamese.  
Hanoi is special because, first, it's the capital city. It's supposed to have some of the best things in the country.  
But then, I think the special thing about Hanoi is, like, it has this kind of French thought in everything in our daily life mixing with our roots. I think it's like a mix between the East and the West right here in Hanoi.
