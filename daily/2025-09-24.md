"McDonald's has a reputation for cultural imperialism, but that's not 100% true," declares photojournalist Gary He.

In his new book McAtlas, He challenges assumptions about the global fast-food giant, which operates 42,000 stores in more than 100 countries and serves 65 million people a day. While many believe McDonald's has homogenised food culture worldwide, He argues the opposite: that the company has thrived by adapting its menu, architecture and brand to local palates and traditions.

"McDonald's has succeeded because they have brilliantly incorporated local flavours and ingredients – from the McRaclette in Switzerland to egg bulgogi burgers in South Korea and the Halloumi McMuffin in Jordan," He says. "Without adjusting, without localising, without kow-towing to local tastes and local cultures, you can't do business on an international level, no matter how big or powerful you are."

He has been documenting this adaptability for years, starting with casual observations of menu items during his travels. But his real curiosity was sparked by an iftar meal at a McDonald's in Morocco. Searching online for more information, he learned that the chain kept no archives and decided to investigate on his own (McDonald's declined to be involved with his project).

Travelling to 55-plus countries, He spoke with employees and franchisees, observed what locals ordered and hauled bags of food to photograph in his hotel rooms – often sharing it with staff to minimise waste.

### **Canada**

Poutine is a 1950s Quebecois invention of fries covered in cheese curds and gravy. After competitor fast food chain Wendy's attempted to have it named Canada's national dish through a "poutition" in 2012, McDonald's put it on menus across the country, even creating an exclusive version: Spicy Buffalo Chicken Poutine. Fun fact: Canada is the only country with its own McDonald's logo – a maple leaf embedded in the Golden Arches.

### **France**

In the early 2000s, McDonald's won over French consumers – many of whom had fiercely resisted the chain's arrival – by marketing itself as local, healthy and environmentally responsible. In 2012, the company introduced a limited-time menu item celebrating a national icon: the baguette, recognised by Unesco as part of France's cultural heritage. Filled with two beef patties, Emmental cheese, lettuce and mustard, the McBaguette was a hit. Today, the French embrace McDonald's so much so that they've even given it an affectionate nickname: McDo (pronounced "Mack-Dough").

### **Sweden**

McSki opened in 1996 in the village of Sälen in western Sweden and is the sole seasonal McDonald's, only open in the winter. While there are plenty of seats for both indoor and outdoor dining (as well as ski racks), this location also has a ski-through window… the only one that exists in the world.
