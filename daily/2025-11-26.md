ALY VANCE

I'm **channeling** my inner Grace Kelly(葛麗絲凱莉), who **epitomized vintage** movie **glamour** when she was **behind the wheel** of a **convertible** in the '50s **thriller**, *To Catch a Thief*. **My partner in crime** is a car that is no stranger to Hollywood fame. The Ford Mustang(福特野馬) has been in more than 500 movies from favorites like James Bond's(詹姆士龐德) *Goldfinger*  to more recent films such as *Gone in 60 Seconds*.

It's also a favorite amongst celebrities-famous names such as Bill Clinton(比爾柯林頓) and Charlie Sheen(查理辛) **opting** to own similar rides. This perfectly-preserved 1966 edition's **immaculate interior** makes you feel like you're stepping back in time, but it's a smooth ride with a sporty **edge**. It likes to **cruise** and, certainly, looks good doing it.
It **turns a few heads** as I stop to pick up my tour guide for the afternoon: David Jarvi, an expert in the **standout** industry sites of the city, and our first stop of the afternoon allows me to take in most of them. This stunning view-the reason many stars of stage and screen make this area their home.

DAVID ,TOUR GUIDE

We're in the Hollywood Hills. We're in the Santa Monica mountain **range** , and, of course, you see so many beautiful homes, and you can see the skyscrapers of Downtown. And in the distance, you can even see the San Gabriel mountain range out there, which, of course, is the **backdrop** for the beautiful Santa Anita Park. Keanu Reeves(基努李維) lives **around the corner**-has for over a decade now. Leonardo Di Caprio (李奧納多皮卡皮歐) has a two-lot **compound**. So, a lotta different celebs love these neighborhoods, and you can see why.

Directly below us is West Hollywood's Sunset Strip, where we're heading next-to what is one of LA's biggest tourist attractions: the Walk of Fame, where the stars, **literally**, line the sidewalk.

DAVID JARVI, TOUR GUIDE

It... this is where the Walk of Fame begins. You can see it gets busy out here. You got Madame Tussaud's Hollywood wax museum(杜莎夫人蠟像好萊塢分館), here on our left, and the world-famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre(格勞曼中國戲院), built in 1927. It's where a lot of the big movies will **premiere**. Right here, it's where the famous footprints and handprints of film legends are pressed into wet **cement**.

Right through here, and it's a shopping mall, and the stars walk through a shopping mall on their way into the Academy Awards. They're constantly adding new names to the Walk of Fame. Right now, if you're... if you wanna get your name on a star, you must be famous, you must be invited by the Hollywood **Chamber** of **Commerce** and you ... you’ve gotta pay—it's not free.
