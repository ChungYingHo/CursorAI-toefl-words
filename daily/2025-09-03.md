The Alaska `pipeline` starts at the frozen `edge` of the Arctic Ocean. It `stretches` southward across the largest and northernmost state in the United States, ending at a remote ice-free seaport village nearly 800 miles from where it begins. It is massive in size and extremely complicated to `operate`.

The steel pipe crosses `windswept` plains and `endless` miles of `delicate` tundra that tops the frozen ground. It `weaves` through `crooked` `canyons`, climbs `sheer` mountains, `plunges` over rocky `crags`, makes its way through `thick` forests, and passes over or under hundreds of rivers and streams.

The pipe is 4 feet in `diameter`, and up to 2 million barrels (or 84 million gallons) of crude oil can be pumped through it daily. Resting on H-shaped steel `racks` called "bents," long sections of the pipeline follow a `zigzag` `course` high above the frozen earth. Other long sections drop out of `sight` `beneath` spongy or rocky ground and return to the surface later on.

The `pattern` of the pipeline's up-and-down route is `determined` by the often `harsh` demands of the arctic and subarctic climate, the `tortuous lay` of the land, and the varied compositions of soil, rock, or permafrost (permanently frozen ground). A little more than half of the pipeline is `elevated` above the ground. The `remainder` is `buried` anywhere from 3 to 12 feet, depending largely upon the type of `terrain` and the properties of the soil.

One of the largest in the world, the pipeline cost approximately $8 billion and is by far the biggest and most expensive construction project ever `undertaken` by private industry. In fact, no single business could raise that much money, so eight major oil companies formed a `consortium` in order to share the costs. Each company controlled oil rights to particular shares of land in the oil fields and paid into the pipeline-construction fund according to the size of its holdings.

Today, despite `enormous` problems of climate, supply shortages, equipment breakdowns, `labor` `disagreements`, `treacherous` `terrain`, a certain amount of mismanagement, and even theft, the Alaska pipeline has been completed and is operating.
