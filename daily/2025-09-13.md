Summer's over, the holidays feel like a distant memory and suddenly the world is back at full speed.  

And that back-to-it energy can leave many of us feeling `stretched thin`.  

Stress, in small doses, can help us stay sharp but left unchecked, it can `chip away at` our health, `mood` and `relationships`.  

`Cortisol`, often labelled as the stress hormone has become a bit of a wellness `buzzword` but it's worth remembering that it isn't the enemy - it's what helps us wake up, stay `alert`, and `handle` challenges.  

The trick is keeping it in balance, not eliminating it.  

Here are five simple, science-backed ways to manage stress and get back in control.  


1. Stop stressing about it
Ironically, worrying about the effects of stress can make it worse.  

The more we talk about how much harm stress does, we start to think 'agh now I'm stressed and I know it's doing me lots of harm', so try not to worry about how you're feeling.  

Stress is a normal part of life and is unavoidable especially during major challenges like `grief`, caring for loved ones, looking after young children or `navigating` job uncertainties.  

Instead of panicking about being stressed, accept that it happens and remind yourself it won't last forever.  

2. Move your body
The best way to physically manage stress is to exercise.  

Exercise does the same thing to your body as stress does - it raises your heart rate, puts your blood pressure up, makes you `toss and turn` faster and releases adrenaline (腎上腺素) and `cortisol`.  

By exercising, your body is learning to manage the cortisol `spikes` and `handle` those surges so you're better equipped to manage life's bigger stresses.  

If you're getting stressed thinking about what exercise you're going to do or what gym to join, remember that any form of exercise is great.  

It doesn't have to be anything too `time consuming` or `high pressured` - a simple walk, jog or any activity you enjoy will do the trick.  

3. Prioritise sleep
Try and get into bed earlier and wake up at roughly the same time in the morning so your body gets into a routine.  

If you find yourself `tossing and turning` at night and not being able to fall asleep, don't worry.  

Your body can function on less sleep occasionally and over time your natural rhythms will `recalibrate`.  


4. Focus on yourself
Managing stress isn't just about avoiding the negatives, it's also about actively building yourself up.  

Make sure you're eating well with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole foods and good-quality proteins to `fuel your body`.  

Try and also `carve out (time)` some quality alone time where you can relax and `recharge`.  

`Mindfulness` can also help - it's not about using a meditation app or sitting in silence, it's about `being intentional in` how you approach your life.  

Take a few minutes to think about the day or week ahead of you, what might be challenging and how you can `pace yourself`.  

For me, it's about planning ahead with `batch cooking` as that can relieve some stress in the evening after work.  

5. Talk it out
I get terribly `anxious` about all kinds of things and everyone worries about money, jobs and families.  

Those worries can quickly `spiral` when kept `bottled up` so sharing your concerns with someone you trust `lightens the load` and gives perspective, even if they can't solve the problem for you.  

Sometimes just saying it out loud makes the problem feel more `manageable`.
