**CNN NARRATOR**
More than 12 million people call the city of São Paulo home. It is South America's biggest `urban` area-larger than London and Paris put together. The city also `boasts` an `impressive` art scene, from the São Paulo Museum of Art to the `famed` `Municipal` Theatre, which `hosted` the Modern Art Week in 1922. Nearly a century later, that event is still `regarded` as a cultural icon, `sparking` a modern art `revolution` in São Paulo.
Lately, tourists have been `flocking` here to the Vila Madalena neighborhood, where street art has evolved over the last few decades into a celebration of modern art.

**MAZU PROZAK, ARTIST**
I like it because it's, kind of, a `metaphor`. The `saturation` of the colors means how our life is saturated by a bunch of things.
So, I'm Prozak. I live in São Paulo. I'm an artist here. I do art on the streets and, of course, in a `studio` as well. We are here at my studio-Local Studio-a place that I share with three other artists. And we’ve been doing this for a long time now-around 20 years.

And we are locals from the Vila Madalena. That's why the name of this studio is Local Studio.

**CNN NARRATOR**
Artists like Prozak call this part of the city home. They've seen the `transformation` and `documented` it in their art. Now, people line the streets here to document it themselves on social media.

**MAZU PROZAK, ARTIST**
What art means to me is a way to `communicate` to people to try to make a change in the world. And I loved it since I was a child. I always liked drawing. I always liked to watch cartoons or read.

And so, the first thing is to love, and I think it's possible to everyone because the second thing is to work a lot, and everyone that works a lot can be an artist as well.
