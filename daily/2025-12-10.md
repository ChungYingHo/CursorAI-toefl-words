If you're feeling like the real meaning of Christmas got buried under mountains of `wrapping` paper, looking at how other countries celebrate can be surprisingly grounding. Traditions vary dramatically from place to place, shaped by landscape, history, values and climate. While many nations do exchange gifts, the `rituals` around them differ `enormously`. These `long-loved` `customs` show us that Christmas doesn't need to be `transactional`; it can be `collaborative`, creative or community-driven, from singing in `candlelit` churches to quietly honouring family – or even appreciating spiders.

From remembering `departed` loved ones to leaning into a multi-generational game, here are seven Christmas traditions you can adopt wherever you are.

1. **Iceland: Reading by candlelight after Christmas dinner**

In Iceland, publishers release `a flurry of` new releases in the `run-up` to Christmas – a seasonal `phenomenon` known as the *jólabókaflóð*, or "Christmas book flood". The tradition dates back to World War Two, when most goods were `rationed` except paper, making books the most practical Christmas gift. Today, it helps support the `niche` Icelandic publishing industry; strengthens a love of the Icelandic language, which is at risk of dying out; and `delights` booklovers nationwide.

On 24 December, families exchange presents, eat Christmas dinner and then spend the evening reading their new books by candlelight, perhaps with a box of chocolates and a drink beside them. It's a ritual that feels `distinctly` Icelandic, but one of the easiest to replicate anywhere.

1. **Denmark: Making homemade `decorations`**

A *klippe klistre* day – `literally` "cutting and sticking" – is an essential Danish ritual. Homes, schools and workplaces across the country hold `crafting` `sessions` to make `elaborate` `garlands`, `braided` stars and paper hearts to bring Christmas cheer to classrooms, offices and living rooms.

It's a chance to `hygge` together and build a sense of community through creativity, all fuelled by *æbleskiver* (small Christmas doughnuts), cookies and *gløgg*, Denmark's potent `mulled wine`. After years of practice, Danes seem able to turn the thinnest twist of paper into something quite magical – but even a simple paper garland can being a touch of Scandinavian `craftiness to your home.
