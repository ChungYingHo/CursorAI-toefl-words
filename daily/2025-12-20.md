The Canadian city of Montréal is a  `delicate` mix of old-world European charm and North American urban `allure`. Located in the `province` of Québec, it's the `epicenter` of French-Canadian culture. This city boasts bold architecture, athletic excellence and stunning landscapes-even under blankets of snow.

This `eccentric` hotel is made up of 500 tons of ice and 30,000 tons of snow. And it takes nearly 6 weeks and about 50 workers and `sculptors` to bring this `enchanting` place to life.
This evening, hotel founder Jacques Desbois is showing me the ins and outs of his colorful creation.
Each year, you re-create the hotel completely `anew`, don't you? I mean, that must take so much time, and effort, and passion and thought.

JACQUES DESBOIS, FOUNDER, HOTEL DE GLACE

Well, re-creating the magic of the ice hotel every year...... it's a `nonstop` process, you know? From the moment we start to build this one, in a certain way, we are already coming up with ideas for the next one. But it's a team effort.

JAMES WILLIAMS, CNN CORRESPONDENT

Consisting of 44 rooms, the hotel welcomes guests to spend the night in one of the `intricately` designed suites.
Look at that! So, what were you trying to create here?

JACQUES DESBOIS, FOUNDER, HOTEL DE GLACE
Well, I ... an action scene of life in the northern area-territory-of Québec: the snow owl which is catching its dinner. And the snow owl is the `emblematic` bird of Québec.

JAMES WILLIAMS, CNN CORRESPONDENT
I mean, each room really tells its own story, doesn't it?

JACQUES DESBOIS, FOUNDER, HOTEL DE GLACE
Yeah, sure, absolutely. And we want people to feel the life of the north, and this is part of what can be happening in the north. And that's obviously wildlife.

JAMES WILLIAMS, CNN CORRESPONDENT

Of course with this much ice, the rooms themselves are pretty cold, with the temperature inside being around `negative` 5 degrees `Celsius`.
And now, making my way closer to `metropolitan` Montréal, I'm surrounded by one of Canada's most recognized symbols: the maple tree. The tree's leaf is the country's national symbol, while the tree itself is Canada's `arboreal` emblem. It's the sugary substance inside these trees that's fueled the nation's maple `syrup` industry for generations.

As the weather changes, the tree `contracts`, and it forces the maple water out into these blue tubes, which `funnel` it down through the forest and into a nostalgic local institution: a sugar `shack`.

In the maple-producing regions of Canada, sugar shacks are small cabins where the `sap` collected from maple trees is boiled down into maple syrup.
And in the spring, during sapping season, the sugar shacks across Québec open and invite their guests to eat large and extremely sweet meals.
