President Donald Trump has signed a spending bill to reopen the government and end the longest shutdown in US history. He signed the `short-term` budget into law just hours after the House of Representatives voted 222-209 to approve it on Wednesday night, and two days after the Senate `narrowly` approved the same package. In the Oval Office, Trump said the government would now "resume normal operations" after "people were hurt so badly" from the 43-day shutdown. Many government services have been suspended since October, and around 1.4 million federal employees have been on unpaid leave or working without pay. Food `aid` has also been left in `limbo` and air travel has been `disrupted` `nationwide`. Government services are expected to reopen in the coming days, while disruptions to air travel will likely ease ahead of the `looming` Thanksgiving holiday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had reduced air traffic because of staff shortages `owing to` the shutdown, which also affected members of Congress `attempting` to reach the nation’s capital for the House vote. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican, rode his motorcycle nearly 1,000 miles (1,609km) across the country to `cast` his vote in the House before it was sent to the president's desk. The bill only provides funding to keep the government open until 30 January, when lawmakers will once again need to find a way to fund the government.

Before he signed it into law, Trump repeatedly `cast` `blame` for the shutdown on the Democratic Party, saying, "They did it `purely` for political reasons." He also warned, "When we come up to `midterms` and other things, don't forget what they've done to our country." Senate Democrats were able to `trigger` the shutdown `despite` being a `minority` in the chamber, because Republicans were still seven short of the 60-vote threshold required to pass a funding bill. They initially `refused` to support the bill, `demanding` that Republicans agree to extend health `insurance` `subsidies` for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans maintained that a healthcare discussion could come after the government was reopened.

On Sunday, a group of eight Senate Democrats broke from the party and helped pass the spending package, voting for it in exchange for a promise of a vote on those healthcare subsidies in December. This decision led to `fury` within the Democratic Party, with public criticism from `figures` such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and California Governor Gavin Newsom. Senator Chuck Schumer said the package "fails to do anything of `substance` to fix America's healthcare crisis." However, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, who voted in `favour` of the `compromise`, `defended the move`, saying the federal workers he `represents` were "saying thank you" for agreeing the deal.

Hours before the House voted to reopen the government, Democrats in Congress watched as their newest lawmaker, Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, was `sworn` into office. Her addition did not provide enough `leverage` to affect whether healthcare subsidies were included in the funding bill, but Democrats welcomed her with `applause`. Grijalva, elected on 23 September, had her `swearing-in` delayed because the House had not been in `session` since 19 September. She succeeds her `late` father, Raul Grijalva, who died earlier this year. Immediately after joining, she supported a `petition` to `force` a vote on `legislation` requiring the release of `files` related to the late `paedophile` `financier` Jeffrey Epstein. The `petition` must remain for seven legislative days before being called for `consideration`, and House leadership must schedule a vote within two legislative days. Speaker Mike Johnson surprised many by announcing that he would schedule a vote next week.

What's in the spending deal? The agreement extends funding for the federal government until 30 January. It also includes full-year funding for the Department of Agriculture, as well as funding for `military` construction and legislative agencies. The bill `guarantees` that all federal workers will be paid for time lost during the shutdown and continues funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food aid to `one in eight` Americans, until next September. Finally, it includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending the healthcare subsidies that Democrats had been demanding `concessions` for.
