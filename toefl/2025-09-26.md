title: Mosquito-borne killer disease threatens blackbirds

A `mosquito-borne` disease freshly arrived in `Britain` has spread large distances, with scientists racing to understand the risks to wild birds. Infected insects can spread the deadly `Usutu` virus to blackbirds, raising fears for the famous `songsters`. New data shows Usutu has spread across much of southern England in five years, and has been linked to declines in some blackbird populations. Scientists are monitoring its spread `amid` warnings that mosquitoes and the diseases they carry may expand their range under climate change. "We've seen that the virus has spread further than we thought it might do, and it's `persisted`," Dr Arran Folly of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) told the BBC.

Scientists at the APHA in Weybridge, Surrey, have been tracking mosquito-borne diseases in wild birds for decades, amid warnings that climate change is turning Europe into a potential breeding ground for the insects. Longer summers, hotter temperatures and heavy rainfall are creating conditions for the `nuisance` insects to move into areas that were previously `inhospitable` to them. Until 2020, all results came back clear. Then, after the summer heatwave of that year, Usutu was detected in several blackbirds in Greater London. "Blackbirds `specifically` are quite `susceptible` to the virus and since 2020 we've found a decline in blackbirds of `approximately` 40% in `Greater London`," said Dr Folly. "It gives an `indication` that in the future we might get other viruses that are `transmitted` by mosquitoes `emerging` in the UK." Diseases such as Usutu are a growing threat to wild birds, amid a host of other pressures, including habitat loss, climate change and pesticide use.

## What is Usutu?
Usutu virus was first detected more than half a century ago around southern Africa's Usutu River. It has since spread around the world, reaching Europe three decades ago, and was picked up for the first time in the UK in 2020. Blackbirds are `particularly` susceptible to the virus, which can also infect horses and, from time to time, humans. The virus is `regarded` as generally of low risk to people, and there have been no human cases reported in the UK to date.

The latest data shows that Usutu has spread further than the scientists expected. It has now been detected in wild birds across much of southern England, at least as far west as `Dorset` and as far north as `Cambridgeshire`. How big a risk Usutu `poses` to wild birds is `uncertain`. The virus has been linked to `mass die-offs` of blackbirds `elsewhere` in Europe, though that doesn't seem to be the case in Britain. And the blackbird `remains` one of the commonest garden birds with numbers `holding steady` in many parts of the country, especially in `rural` areas, and in the north.

To `untangle` the puzzle – and gather more data on blackbird numbers – the scientists have joined `forces` with the British Trust for `Ornithology` (BTO). They are calling for volunteers to count blackbirds in their gardens over the summer months to find out more about the comings and goings of the birds. Around now blackbirds are breeding and raising their young, frequently seen hopping along the ground and singing from the branches of trees on summer evenings.

Lucy Love, a garden birdwatch `ambassador` for the BTO, knows the blackbirds in her gardens by sight and has grown `fond` of them. "They're beautiful birds – `intelligent`, friendly and they have the most beautiful song with a lovely melodic tone to it," she explained. "And we cannot lose them – they're a `vital` part of our ecosystem."


:::summary
Usutu 病毒是一種由蚊子傳播的疾病，近年在英國快速擴散。  
這種病毒最早在非洲被發現，大約 30 年前傳入歐洲，並於 2020 年首次在英國檢測出現。  

Usutu 對黑鳥（blackbird）影響特別大，在倫敦地區的黑鳥族群數量因為感染大幅下降，2020 年以來約減少了 40%。  
科學家推測這與氣候變遷、棲地喪失以及殺蟲劑使用等多重壓力有關。  

雖然該病毒也能感染馬匹，偶爾也會感染人類，但對人類的風險被認為很低，英國目前沒有病例。  
由於病毒傳播速度超出預期，科學家與 BTO（英國鳥類學會）的志工合作，號召大眾參與調查，統計花園中的黑鳥數量，以更好了解病毒影響並保護黑鳥。
