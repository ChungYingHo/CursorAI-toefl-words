At least fourteen people have died in eastern Taiwan and scores more are `trapped` or missing after a super typhoon caused a mountain lake to `burst` its `banks`, fire officials said. The `barrier lake`, `formed` by previous `landslides`, broke on Tuesday afternoon, sending water `surging` into the nearby township of Guangfu in Hualien county. `Rescuers` from across Taiwan are heading to the area. Super Typhoon Ragasa is the strongest storm of 2025 and is now `bearing down` on China's southern coast. `It is due to` make `landfall` in Guangdong `province` on Wednesday, where some 370,000 people have been `evacuated`, and many schools and businesses shut. Hong Kong has upgraded its typhoon warning to level 10, the maximum level.

Ragasa – `equivalent` to a Category 5 hurricane – `packed` wind `gusts` of up to 285km/h (177mph) at its `highest point` on Monday, and has triggered warnings of floods, `storm surges` and landslides across the region this week. Taiwan has been `lashed` by the outside edge of Ragasa since Monday. The island recorded almost 60cm (24 inches) of rain in its east due to the typhoon, Reuters news agency reported. In Hualien county the burst lake washed away a bridge, `uprooted` trees and submerged cars. Video showed fast-moving water `flowing` through the area.

"In some places, water `temporarily` `rose` as high as the second floor of a house and was about as high as one floor in the town centre, where the water has been `receding`," Lee Lung-sheng, deputy chief of Hualien County Fire Department, told AFP news `agency`. "About 263 people were trapped and moved up to higher ground when the river suddenly rose. They are not in immediate danger, but they are very worried about the high water." `Elsewhere` in Taiwan six people were `injured`, `ferry` services `suspended` and more than 100 international flights cancelled as Ragasa passed through.

Chinese `authorities` are warning of storm `surges` of up to five metres. Some 370,000 people have been evacuated so far in Guangdong, as authorities warn of a "`catastrophic`" situation. On Tuesday, supermarket `shelves` in Hong Kong were `wiped` empty of fresh bread, vegetables, meat and instant noodles as residents prepared to `hunker down`. Hong Kong International Airport said it expected "significant `disruption` to flight `operations`" from 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday until the next day. More than 500 Cathay `Pacific` flights are expected to be cancelled, while Hong Kong Airlines said it would stop all departures from the city.

Ragasa has been `dubbed` the "King of Storms" by China's `meteorological` agency and is expected to move towards northern Vietnam in the coming days, potentially affecting `millions`. In cities across southern China, shop owners `piled` sandbags in front of their stores in `preparation` for the storm's arrival, with residents in `low-lying` areas next to the sea front particularly worried about `tidal` surges. Many have also taped up the windows of their homes and businesses, hoping to prevent their destruction.

Although this part of southern China and Hong Kong is used to frequent typhoons, the impact this time may be `worsened` because of the location of the storm. `The right hand side` of Ragasa – as it `approaches` Hong Kong and Guangdong – is known as the "`dirty side`" – and it is this which will hit the region. The "dirty side" can be much more destructive than the left-hand side, `primarily` because the `motion` of the storm is added to the background `circulation` of the typhoon. Where these two movements combine is where the most destructive winds are `found`. Additionally, these winds will be pushing water `inland`, resulting in a bigger storm surge.

It is not yet clear `exactly` how much climate change has affected Ragasa `specifically`. But a warming world is expected to make tropical storms like typhoons and hurricanes more `intense` on average, according to UN scientists. That means higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall and a higher risk of `oastal` flooding, although the number of typhoons across east and southeast Asia may decrease in future.

Ragasa also `lashed` through a remote island in the north of the Philippines on Monday, killing at least one person as thousands of families were evacuated before the storm made landfall. Schools and government offices were shut in large parts of the country, including in the capital Manila. Ragasa would "`pose` a serious threat" to Hong Kong, said Eric Chan, the city's Chief Secretary for `Administration`, comparing it to two other typhoons which left `behind` `trails` of severe destruction.

Super typhoon Mangkhut in 2018 – to date the most `intense typhoon` to strike the city – injured 200 people, `sank` ships and `wrecked` `infrastructure`, with the weather agency estimating economic losses of HK$4.6bn ($592m; £438m). In 2017, typhoon Hato `unleashed` serious flooding and injured more than 100 people in the city.
