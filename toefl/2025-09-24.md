title: Why scientists hope seabed mud could reveal Antarctic Ocean secrets

Why would anyone brave `hand-numbing` cold, icy winds and `rough` seas – sometimes working through the night – to `dig up` `mud` from the `Antarctic` seabed? That is what an international team of particularly adventurous researchers did earlier this year in the remote Antarctic `Peninsula`, on a mission `aiming` to `reveal` centuries of scientific secrets about the Southern Ocean. Scientists around the world will now share and `analyse` these precious mud samples to work out how human activity – including a century of industrial `whaling` – affected Antarctica and the rest of our planet. The research is part of a global effort to understand the relationship between the ocean and the climate.

## A history of ocean life
Researchers used a special `coring` `drill` – a bit like a huge apple-corer – tethered to a research ship, to drill at depths of up to 500m. They collected more than 40 long `cores`, or `tubes`, of seafloor `sediment` from locations around the peninsula. This is one of the richest `habitats` for marine life in Antarctica, and a `focal` point for fishing, tourism and – before it was banned in the 1980s – industrial whale hunting. Collecting the sediment gives insight and clues to the past, "like a book of history", explained lead researcher Dr Elisenda Balleste from the University of Barcelona. "What is living in the seas now, what was living in the seas in the past and evidence of our human impact" is recorded in layer upon layer of sediment over centuries, she said. By preserving and dating those layers, and analysing what they contain, researchers can build a picture of the history of Antarctic marine life.

Once on board the ship, the cores were frozen and transported to Barcelona and Dr Balleste's laboratory. From there, carefully `extracted` pieces of this Antarctic mud will be sent out to several academic institutions around the world. Scientists will scan and date the sediment layers, work out what microbial life they contain, measure levels of pollution and calculate how much carbon is `buried` in the mud. It is part of a mission – the Convex Seascape Survey – which `involves` universities and research institutions around the globe working together to better understand how our ocean and climate are connected. Claire Allen, an `oceanographer` from the British Antarctic Survey who has studied Antarctica's past for more than 20 years, said that cores like these were particularly valuable. "Before 1950 – before there was any kind of `monitoring capacity` in Antarctica – sediment cores and ice cores are the only way that we can get an insight into any of the climatic or physical properties that have changed over time," she said.

## The DNA fingerprint from whale hunting
The newly collected samples being stored for DNA analysis have to be kept at temperatures low enough to stop all biological processes. Dr Balleste took them out of the industrial-sized freezer where they are being stored to show them to us, very `briefly`. "They're kept at minus 80 degrees to stop them degrading," she explained. These small pieces of the seabed – frozen in time at temperatures that preserve genetic material – will be used for what is known as environmental DNA analysis. It is an area of science which has developed rapidly in recent years. It gives researchers the ability to extract genetic information from water, soil and even air, like a fingerprint of life left behind in the environment.

Dr Carlos Preckler, from King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia, is leading this part of the research and will be trying to measure how almost a century of industrial whaling in Antarctica affected the ocean and our `atmosphere`. Carbon – when it is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide – warms up our planet like a blanket. So, as the world struggles to reduce those `emissions`, any processes that `absorb` and `lock` significant amounts of carbon might help to `rein` in global warming. "We know whales have a lot of carbon in their bodies, because they are huge animals," said Dr Preckler. What he and his `colleagues` want to know is how much of that carbon gets buried in the seafloor – and locked away from the atmosphere – when the animals die. "We can measure whale DNA and the carbon in the sediment," explained Dr Preckler. "So we can measure what happened before industrial whaling removed most of the whales in the Southern ocean," he added. That, the researchers say, will provide a measure of how much whales – simply by existing, being huge and living out their natural lives – remove carbon from our atmosphere and help in the fight against climate change.

:::note
In this passage, scientists study the history of the Southern Ocean by drilling deep into the Antarctic seabed.  
They collect mud cores, freeze them immediately, and later analyze them in labs around the world.  
From these samples, they can check the age of the layers, the microbes, the pollution, and the amount of carbon stored.  
They also use DNA analysis, which works like a fingerprint, to see what kinds of animals lived in the ocean before.  
One special focus is whales, because they store a lot of carbon in their bodies. When whales die, much of that carbon sinks into the seabed, which helps slow down global warming.  
So overall, the research connects human activities, marine life, and climate change in a very clear way.

本篇講述科學家如何研究南極海洋的歷史。  
他們用鑽機在海床 500 公尺深處取出沉積物岩芯，並立即冷凍保存，以避免 DNA 與沉積層資訊降解，送往世界各地實驗室。  
在實驗室裡，科學家會分析沉積層的年代、微生物群落、汙染程度與碳含量，藉此重建海洋與氣候之間的關係。  
這些沉積物同時能進行 DNA 分析，像生命的「指紋」，能揭示過去海洋生物的存在與人類活動的影響。  
由於南極曾經盛行捕鯨，而鯨魚體內含有大量碳，研究人員想知道牠們死亡後將碳埋入海床的過程，如何幫助減緩氣候變遷。
