`Flax` once defined Northern Ireland, with a `thriving` `linen` industry. But changing consumer habits saw that industry `decline` `massively` in the mid-20th century. Now, the plant is being looked at as a tool to `restore` soil health and even help `decarbonise` `manufacturing`. And it may be a potential `diversification` route for smaller farms, as demand grows for sustainable fibres.

Helen Keys and her `sculptor` husband Charlie Mallon began growing flax when they couldn't `source` Irish linen bags for Charlie's artwork. The crop was grown on Charlie's family farm in County Tyrone in the past. Helen's eyes have been opened to the plant's potential. "There is a real `resurgence` and interest now in natural fibres because we have to look at how we are going to replace things like `carbon fibre`, `fibreglass`," she said. "And natural fibres have a big role to play in `decarbonizing` industry."

Fibre crops like flax and `hemp` have a high nutrient `uptak`e from the soil and a minimal requirement for fertiliser. They are `rotational` crops, which can be alternated with other `arables` like vegetables. For Professor Mark Emmerson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Queen's University Belfast, that means they could play a part in `tackling` `the blue-green algae problem` in `Lough Neagh` by reducing the nutrient `burden` on the land. "I would see flax production and `veg` production as part of a just `transition` that enables farmers to look at what they're doing on the farm and where it's `appropriate` - and only where it's appropriate - to look at putting an `acre` or two, or a `hectare` or two, of land under flax or veg production."

While he is `realistic`, he is also `optimistic` about the potential of different applications of flax. "I'm not sure this is a solution for the big dairy farms," he said. "But of the 26,000 farms in Northern Ireland, 78% of them are `considered` very small, which means that they have less than one person working the farm on any given week and those individuals are having to go off-farm to maintain a second job to maintain the farm. So, you know, an `acre` of flax `in the mix` might actually enable those farmers to stay on farm and work the farm so that the farm is able to pay for itself."

A community `gathering` - a `meitheal`, in ancient Irish tradition - was held at the end of August, bringing volunteers from around the island of Ireland to Helen and Charlie's farm near Cookstown to finish the flax harvest. `Self-confessed` "`flax nut`" Kathy Kirwan travelled from Clonakilty in County Cork to `ake part`. She has fallen in love with the "`circular`" nature of the plant. "Nothing goes to waste, absolutely nothing. Like, 50% of the plant when you're processing it comes out as `shives` (woody material) and that's used for `composite`. We made paper, so no part of it actually goes to waste `whatsoever`. It just fits into the values of protecting the earth, protecting nature, and it needs no pesticides or herbicides."

She has worked with Malú Colorín, from Fibreshed Ireland, which is part of a global `movement` that focuses on `regenerative fashion` using locally grown fibres. "Linen is kind of like the cream of the crop of what you can do with flax, but then you can also create `less fine fibres`, such as rope as well," she said. "And then of course, if you get into the `shive`, the `by-product`, you can get into composites and oil from the seeds and `wax` and `stuff`."

Crafter Cathy Kane and her husband are working to build their own self-sustainable `homestead` in North Cork. Where they live is called Sliabh Luachra, which translated from Irish means `rushy` mountain. "It's very `agrarian` agriculture, forestry, that kind of thing, so flax is perfectly `suited`. Flax is part of my crop rotation in my sort of vegetable garden rotation that I'm kind of planning in my head. And because I like working with fibre, I thought it's perfect."

For Gawain Morrison, `co-founder` of the Belfast climate `initiative` `Brink`! and `co-organiser` of the Flax Meitheal weekend, there is `a sense of` a `desire` for change. "When you see something like this, where you're bringing together people who are `robotics` engineers, composites, farmers, all coming together under the same umbrella to make a difference, that's when you know `a tipping point's coming`. Because everybody's pointing in the same direction."

## 口說範例
In my opinion, flax is a very important crop because it connects both sustainability and farming income.  

First of all, flax can be used to produce natural fibres. It replaces materials like carbon fibre or fibreglass, and even its by-products such as shives and oil can be reused. This shows that nothing goes to waste.  

In addition, flax is suitable for small farms in Northern Ireland. Since most farms are very small, planting just one acre of flax may help farmers stay on their land instead of needing a second job.  

So overall, flax is not only eco-friendly but also practical for supporting small farmers, which is why I think it plays a big role in the future.

本篇在講述 flax 這種植物的重要。  
主要是 flax 可以作為纖維來源，以編織工藝品或工具。  
他作為植物也提供了許多的營養，並且種植他還不需要施太多肥。  
甚至，flax 是輪作作物，可以跟其他蔬菜等作物輪流耕種。  

那也有人指出，Ireland 的農場大多是小農，所以往往需要有其他家人出去尋找另一份生計來維持生活開銷。  
但如果混種 flax，可能有希望可以讓農場自己就足以弭平開銷。
