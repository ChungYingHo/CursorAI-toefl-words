`Salesforce` boss Marc Benioff apologised Friday for suggesting that US President Donald Trump should send National Guard `troops` to San Francisco. The apology followed days of `backlash` against Mr Benioff for a comment he made ahead of his company's annual Dreamforce `conference` in the city. "Having listened closely to my `fellow` San Franciscans... I do not believe the National Guard is needed to `address` safety in San Francisco," he said. The `saga` comes `amid` the Trump `administration's` military deployments to US cities - many of which are led by `Democrats`. Trump on Friday asked the `Supreme Court` to `overrule` lower courts that blocked a National Guard deployment in Chicago.

The `mood` at the usually `jubilant` Dreamforce `convention` was `dampened` by cancelled appearances by San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, as well as `comedians` Kumail Nanjiani and Ilana Glazer. Mr Benioff was `dealt` public `rebukes` from several Democratic `politicians`, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who once served as mayor of San Francisco and appeared on stage with Mr Benioff at last year's `convention`. On Thursday, `venture` `capitalist` Ron Conway resigned from the board of the Salesforce Foundation, telling the New York Times that their values "were no longer `aligned`". "I now barely recognize the person I have so long admired," Conway told the newspaper.

Although Mr Benioff `walked back` his comments earlier in the week, the apology posted on social media on Friday appeared `aimed` at putting the `controversy` to rest. "I remain deeply grateful to Mayor Lurie, SFPD, and all our partners, and am fully `committed` to a safer, stronger San Francisco," Mr Benioff said in his X post. But he noted that his `endorsement` of a `crackdown` "came from an abundance of caution" around Dreamforce security, adding "I sincerely apologize for the concern it caused".

Sylvia Paull, a `veteran` Silicon Valley `publicist`, called Benioff "`typical`" of many tech CEOs who are not "really `political` animals" and tend to be `transactional`. "It was going to hurt his sales." And that's not all. "He's afraid he's going to lose his `legacy,`" she said of his apology. Mr Benioff, who also owns Time Magazine, has been a prolific `donor` to `civic` causes in San Francisco over the years. His name `graces` one of the most `prominent` hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2018, he funded support for a San Francisco `ballot` measure aimed at raising corporate taxes to fund homeless services. It passed, despite controversy. And while he once held a `fundraiser` for Democratic Hillary Clinton's 2016 `presidential` `campaign` against Mr Trump, Mr Benioff appeared with the sitting president during his state visit to London last month.

Mr Trump said Wednesday that San Francisco was one of the next targets on his list of places where he plans to deploy the National Guard, calling the city "a mess." On Friday, in an emergency appeal, the president `urged` the Supreme Court to `permit` him to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago. Lower courts have blocked the deployment there thus far, with an `appeals` court saying such a move would "likely to lead to civil `unrest`" and "only add fuel to the fire". The court ruled that it had "seen no `credible` evidence that there has been `rebellion` in the state of Illinois". Officials in Illinois and Chicago had sued the Trump `administration` to block the deployment, arguing it was a "grave intrusion on Illinois' `sovereignty`". The administration has recently deployed the National Guard to Portland, Oregon in a move that also prompted `lawsuits` and `protests`. It previously sent troops to Los Angeles, Washington and parts of Tennessee.

The New York Times also reported this week that Salesforce `pitched` its services to the Trump administration as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) `ramps` up the hiring of new officers `amid` a crackdown on `immigration`. The BBC has reached out to Salesforce for comment. Trump administration official David Sacks, a Silicon Valley `entrepreneur`, addressed Mr Benioff in a post on X this week, writing "if the Democrats don't want you, we would be happy for you to join our team."

:::summary
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff apologised for suggesting that US President Donald Trump should send National Guard troops to San Francisco. His remarks caused public backlash just before Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference. Benioff later said he had spoken out of “an abundance of caution” about event security and admitted that the National Guard was unnecessary.  
The controversy deepened as politicians and business figures criticised him, and one longtime ally resigned from the Salesforce Foundation board. The issue became entangled with Trump’s broader push to deploy the National Guard in Democratic-led cities such as Chicago, Portland, and Los Angeles—moves that have triggered legal challenges and protests.  
Observers said Benioff’s quick apology was an effort to protect his public image and business interests. Though known for philanthropy and liberal causes, he was accused of acting too pragmatically. The episode reflected the growing tension between technology leaders, politics, and public accountability in the US.

Salesforce 執行長馬克・貝尼奧夫（Marc Benioff）因建議美國總統川普派遣國民兵進駐舊金山而引發爭議，隨後公開道歉。這番言論出現在公司年度 Dreamforce 大會前，引起社會輿論與政治人物批評。貝尼奧夫表示，他之所以發言，是出於對活動安全的「過度謹慎」，並承認其建議並不必要。
事件擴大後，多位民主黨政治人物公開譴責他，一位長期合作的創投人士也辭去 Salesforce 基金會董事職位。這場風波同時與川普政府推動在多個民主黨執政城市（如芝加哥、波特蘭、洛杉磯）部署國民兵的行動交織，引發訴訟與抗議。
評論認為，貝尼奧夫的迅速道歉旨在挽回個人聲譽與商業利益。雖然他長年支持公益與自由派事業，但這次表現被批評過於功利，反映出美國科技領袖在政治與社會責任間的緊張關係。
