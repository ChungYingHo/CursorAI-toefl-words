title: Four potential obstacles in House vote to end US shutdown

A spending bill to end the longest-ever government shutdown is `heading to` the House of Representatives. The lower `chamber` of `Congress` is expected to vote by Wednesday evening on the funding measure. Unlike in the Senate, if House Republicans stay united, they don't need any Democrats to pass the budget. But the `margin` for error is `razor` `thin`. Here are four potential `hold-ups` for the budget, before it can clear Congress and land on the president's desk for signing into law.

Will House Republicans budge on healthcare?  
A key `sticking point` throughout the shutdown has been a desire on the part of Democrats to attach to the spending bill a `renewal` of tax credits that make health `insurance` less expensive for 24 million Americans. Senate Republicans instead only agreed to `grant` Democrats a vote in December on whether to extend the `subsidies` – something they had already offered weeks ago. And House Speaker Mike Johnson has not `committed` to allowing a vote in his chamber on the tax credits. This `entails` a fair degree of political risk for Republicans, however. If they `torpedo` the subsidies, health coverage `premiums` could `rocket`, handing Democrats a ready-made `campaign` issue for next year's midterm `elections`. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a `conservative` Republican `congresswoman` from Georgia, has broken ranks with President Donald Trump to say she is "disgusted" premiums could double for her own grown-up children. The president said on Monday his `ally` had "lost her way". As the clock `ticks down` to the subsidies `expiring` by the end of December, Republicans have not yet `finalised` their plan. They want income caps on who can receive the tax credits, and are `proposing` the tax dollars bypass insurance companies and go straight to individuals - although the details are unclear.

How `intense` will House Democratic opposition be?  
Out of power in Washington, where Trump's Republicans control the House and Senate, Democrats appeared finally to have some political wind in their `sails` after a handful of election wins last week in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City. But those victories, like the shutdown fight, have `accentuated` strategic `tensions` between the `pragmatic` and `progressive`, or `left-wing`, `factions` of the party. The Democratic left is `furious` at `defectors` who voted with Senate Republicans to pass the budget on Monday, seeing this as a `capitulation` to Trump. From that wing of the party, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said giving up the fight was a "`horrific` mistake". California Governor Gavin Newsom called it "`surrender`". House Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York told CNN on Tuesday: "We're strongly `opposed` as House Democrats to this `reckless` Republican effort to continue to raise the high cost of living on everyday Americans." However, centrist Democrats like Jared Golden of Maine, who recently announced he won't run for re-election, may cross the `aisle`. Another moderate Democrat, Henry Cuellar of Texas, has indicated he may help get the Republicans' spending plan over the line.

Do Republicans have the votes?  
Once a Democratic congresswoman-elect from Arizona is `sworn` in on Wednesday the Republican majority in the House will be whittled down to five votes – 219-214. Republicans can only afford to lose two votes to pass the spending plan. While most House Republicans are expected to support the funding package, given that Trump backs it, `fiscal` `hawks` may object. The `proposed` deal would leave the federal government on a path to keep adding about $1.8tn (£1.4tn) a year to its $38tn of `debt`. Potential Republican `defectors` Thomas Massie of Kentucky or Victoria Spartz of Indiana have `remained` `tight-lipped` so far on how they plan to vote. But congressman Chip Roy of Texas said he was "`unaware` of any `opposition` of significance" to the bill from members of his `conservative` House Freedom Caucus.

Will travel `chaos` delay the return to Washington?  
House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the chamber out of `session` for the last seven weeks to focus pressure on Senate Democrats to make a shutdown deal. He has `urged` `lawmakers` to return to Washington immediately for the `crunch` vote. But members of Congress face the same flight delays that have `plagued` other Americans during the spending `impasse`. With nearly 1,200 flights cancelled on Tuesday as unpaid air traffic controllers call in sick because of the funding `deadlock`, lawmakers are finding other ways to reach Washington. Republican congressmen Rick Crawford of Arkansas and Trent Kelly of Mississippi are `carpooling` to the nation's capital. Congressman Derrick Van Orden said he was riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle from his home state of Wisconsin. Record-cold temperatures and heavy snow have also hit the Great Lakes region in the Midwest, adding to the delays.

:::summary
這篇文章講述美國國會正在審議一項政府支出法案（spending bill），用來結束史上最久的政府關門。眾議院預計週三晚間表決，但由於共和黨只領先少數席位，稍有叛離就可能表決失敗。
主要有四個變數：  

醫療補助爭議
民主黨想把延長醫療保險稅收抵免（補貼）的條款放進法案，但共和黨只願意讓他們在十二月另行表決。若補助失效，保費可能飆漲，對共和黨的政治形象很危險。

民主黨內部分歧
部分進步派批評溫和派在參議院與共和黨妥協，是向川普投降。像桑德斯稱這是「可怕的錯誤」。但也有中間派議員可能倒戈支持法案。

共和黨票數壓力
一名民主黨議員即將宣誓上任，使共和黨在眾議院的優勢僅剩五席，只能最多失兩票。多數共和黨支持這項法案，但仍有少數「財政保守派」可能反對。

交通延誤變數
因為關門影響航管員領薪，許多航班被取消，部分議員趕不回華府。有人開車、有人騎重機趕回國會。惡劣天氣讓情況更糟
