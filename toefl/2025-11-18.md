title: Thousands march outside COP30 summit in call for action

`Marching` to the beat of `pounding` sound systems, thousands of climate protesters have been bringing their message to the gates of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil. `Chanting` and singing "free the Amazon", `demonstrators` in `host` city Belém carried three giant coffins reading Oil, Coal and Gas, `flanked` by two `grim` reapers. `Indigenous` groups displayed signs reading "the answer is us" as an `inflatable` elephant and `anaconda` `weaved` through the crowd under the hot sun. It is the first time since 2021 that protesters have been allowed to demonstrate outside the UN climate talks, as the last three were held in countries that do not permit public `protest`. "We are holding a `funeral` for fossil fuels," said Tuga Cíntia from the `theatre` group Hydra Dance at the Federal University of Pará. "I'm here because enough is enough with COP meetings and theory. It's time for us to actually act," she added.

Indigenous communities, Brazilian youth groups, and activists from around the world joined the march in their thousands. As the `midday` sun `intensified`, some `sought` `shelter` in a `petrol` station `forecourt`. "Fossil fuels are still being burned. We know all too well what it's like to live on the frontline of climate change," said Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from Samoa. "We are here after so many COPS, marching for justice, for the end of fossil fuels," said Ilan, from the NGO 350 in Brazil. Some carried signs reading "`demarcation` now", calling for indigenous groups to be given `legal` ownership of their `territories`. Hundreds of indigenous groups live in the Amazon and are `regarded` by `experts` as the best protectors of biodiversity and forests. Smaller sister protests have taken place around the world, including in the UK.

Security was `tight` at the COP30 `venue` as police with `riot` shields guarded the entrance. On Tuesday protesters carrying signs broke through security lines at the `summit`, causing minor `injuries` to two security staff and some limited damage to the venue. `Representation` of indigenous voices has been a `flashpoint` in these talks, with some setting up `stalls` outside the `fenced-off` venue to sell products to `delegates`. The meeting was `dubbed` the "indigenous people's COP", but many groups feel their concerns over `deforestation`, land protection and resource `extraction` are not being heard.

`Negotiations` continued at the COP30 talks on Saturday, as nearly 200 countries met to try to make progress on tackling climate change. Little progress was made in the first week, though some `delegations` said they were pushing for a strategy to `deliver` on past promises to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels. President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is hosting the talks and `chose` Belém to put the world's focus on the Amazon. But shortly before the talks opened, his government `granted` permission to the Brazilian state oil company to explore for oil at the mouth of the Amazon.

On Friday, analysis of `attendee` lists by the `coalition` Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) suggested a record number of delegates from fossil fuel companies were attending the meeting. It estimated 1,600 `lobbyists` were in Belém, a 12% rise from last year's COP. It is common for business leaders to come to the talks to strike deals. With the US `strikingly` `absent` from negotiations, progress has been slow. It is the first time the country has sent no delegation after President Donald Trump `branded` climate change "`a con`". Earlier in the week, senior climate leaders wrote a letter `urging` the `summit` to ensure that facts about climate change were `upheld`. Ten countries have since signed the Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change, launched by the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change. The declaration aims to create international commitments to address climate `disinformation` and promote evidence-based information. On the core issues of tackling the root causes of climate change and helping countries adapt to ongoing warming, Brazil has promised that COP30 will deliver concrete action on years of deals and `pledges`.

:::summary
Thousands of climate protesters marched in Belém, Brazil, during the COP30 UN climate talks, demanding an end to fossil fuels and stronger action to protect the Amazon. Indigenous groups and global activists joined, highlighting issues like deforestation and land rights. Security was tight after some protesters broke through barriers. Meanwhile, negotiations among nearly 200 nations showed little progress, as fossil fuel interests remained influential—over 1,600 lobbyists attended. The U.S. was notably absent, slowing diplomatic efforts. Despite Brazil’s promise to lead on climate, its approval of new oil exploration drew criticism. A new declaration on climate information integrity was launched to counter misinformation and push for concrete action against global warming.

在巴西貝倫舉行的 COP30 聯合國氣候會議期間，數千名氣候抗議者上街遊行，要求終結化石燃料並加強對亞馬遜雨林的保護。原住民團體與來自世界各地的行動者共同參與，呼籲重視森林砍伐與土地權問題。部分抗議者突破封鎖線後，現場警戒升高。與此同時，近 200 個國家的談判進展有限，化石燃料業者仍影響深遠——有超過 1600 名遊說人士出席。美國缺席使外交協商更為艱難。儘管巴西宣稱要在氣候行動上領導全球，但其批准新的亞馬遜近海石油探勘引發批評。此外，會議上也推出《氣候資訊誠信宣言》，以對抗錯誤資訊並推動具體減碳行動。
