More than 100 schools have been closed in the north east of Scotland, with heavy snow causing `further` disruption across the region. Aberdeenshire Council listed dozens of schools that were unable to open following another night of wintry weather conditions. On the roads, part of the A90 was closed for several hours and a double-`decker` bus was `stuck` in snow on the Banchory to Torphins road in Aberdeenshire. A yellow warning for snow and ice in the north of Scotland remains in place until 21:00. There is also a new yellow warning for ice, covering Grampian, Highland, Orkney and Shetland, from 21:00 until 11:00 on Friday. The weather conditions have also led to the closure of some schools in Moray and the Highlands, with several more delaying opening until later.

Conditions were difficult on many roads across the region. The A90 was closed between Aberdeen at the Cleanhill `roundabout` and the Stonehaven roundabout on Thursday morning, but reopened in the afternoon. In Aberdeen, two people were taken to hospital after a car hit a `pedestrian` at about 06:30 on Wellington Road. The route was closed between Tullos Road and Abbotswell Road, and police advised `motorists` to avoid the area. The road re-opened in the afternoon. The snow gates were closed on the A939 Cockbridge to Tomintoul road and the B974 Banchory to Fettercairn. Aberdeen International Airport said flight disruption had been "minimal", but four flights had been cancelled.

Scottish transport `operators` `outlined` their winter `resilience` plans last week. This included `stocking up` on 497,000 tonnes of salt - more than was used for the `entirety` of last winter. Aberdeen City Council said `gritters` on its primary routes are `fitted` with `snowplough` `attachments` so are `ploughing` and `gritting` at the same time. "We cannot be everywhere at all times so remind people to listen to police and travel advice and allow for extra time for journeys," the council said. The Met Office said there was a potential for lows of -12C in areas of lying snow continuing into Friday in parts of Scotland.

Typical overnight temperatures at this time of year range from 2C in Scotland to 5C in the south of England. During the first week in November they rarely `fell into single figures`, instead `hovering` at about 10C to 14C. Last November, temperatures below -10C were recorded in some parts of northern Scotland, including Braemar in Aberdeenshire which reached a low of -11.2C.
