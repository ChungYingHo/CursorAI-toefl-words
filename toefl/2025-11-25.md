title: UN climate talks fail to secure new fossil fuel promises

Following `bitter` rows, the UN climate summit COP30 in Belém, Brazil has ended with a deal that contains no direct reference to the fossil fuels that are heating up the planet. It is a `frustrating` end for more than 80 countries including the UK and EU that wanted the meeting to commit the world to stop using oil, `coal` and gas at a faster `pace`. But oil-producing nations held the line that they should be allowed to use their fossil fuel resources to grow their economies. The meeting takes place as the UN says it fears global efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels have failed.

A `representative` for Colombia `furiously` criticised the COP `presidency` for not allowing countries to object to the deal in the final meeting on Saturday, known as a `plenary`. "Colombia believes that we have `sufficient` scientific evidence saying that more than 75% of the global greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuels," Daniela Durán González, Colombian Climate Delegate, told BBC News. "So we do believe it's time that the `Convention` on Climate Change starts talking about that reality," she added. The final deal, called the Mutirão, calls on countries to "`voluntarily`" `accelerate` their action to reduce their use of fossil fuels.

For the first time, the US did not send a `delegation` after President Donald Trump said the country will leave the landmark Paris `treaty` that `committed` countries to act on climate change in 2015. He has `branded` climate change "a `con`". Veteran negotiator and former Germany climate `envoy` Jennifer Morgan told the BBC that the US `absence` was a "hole" in the negotiations. Often the US has supported `blocs` like the EU and UK. "In a 12-hour negotiation overnight, when you have oil-producing countries pushing back hard, to not have someone `counteracting` on that, it certainly was hard," she said. But for many countries, the fact that the talks did not `collapse` or roll back on past climate agreements is a `relief`. Antigua and Barbuda Climate Ambassador Ruleta Thomas commented: "We are happy that there is a process that continues to function where every country can be heard." In the final meeting, a representative for Saudi Arabia said: "Each state must be allowed to build its own path, based on its respective `circumstances` and economies." Like many other leading oil-producing nations, the country has argued it should be allowed to `exploit` its fossil fuel reserves as others have done in the past.

The two weeks of talks were at times `chaotic`. Toilets ran out of water, `torrential` `thunderstorms` `flooded` the `venue`, and `delegates` struggled to `cope` in hot, humid rooms. The COP's around 50,000 registered delegates were evacuated twice. A group of about 150 `protestors` broke into the venue, breaching security lines, and carrying `placards` reading "our forests are not for sale". On Thursday a large fire `broke out`, `scorching` a hole into the `roof` and `forcing` participants to rush outside. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva chose the city of Belém to put the world's attention on the Amazon rainforest and to bring a `rush` of finance to the city. Despite its desire for a more ambitious fossil fuel agreement, Brazil was criticised for its own plans to `drill` for oil at the mouth of the Amazon. Its `offshore` oil and gas production is on course to increase until the early 2030s, according to analysis shared with the BBC by campaign group Global Witness.

Countries at the talks have `competing` interests, depending on their national circumstances and how `exposed` they are to the effects of climate change. Some countries were happy about the outcomes. India `praised` the deal, calling it "meaningful". A group representing the interests of 39 small island and `low-lying` coastal states on Saturday called it "`imperfect`" but still a step towards "progress". Poorer nations have come away with a promise for more climate finance to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change. "It has `moved the needle`. There is a clearer `recognition` that those with historic responsibility countries that `emitted` more planet-warming gases in the past have specific `duties` on climate finance," said Sierra Leone Minister of The Environment and Climate Change Jiwoh Abdulai.

But it's a `sour` end for more than 80 countries, who negotiated through the night to keep stronger fossil fuel language in the deal. UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband `insisted` the meeting is a "step forward". "I would have preferred a more ambitious agreement," he said. "We're not going to hide the fact that we would have preferred to have more, to have more ambition on everything," EU climate `commissioner` Wopke Hoekstra told journalists. With lush trees, bird cries and intense humidity, it was hard to escape the Amazonian `backdrop` of the talks. Brazil launched the talks with a new fund called Tropical Forests Forever Facility that would pay countries to protect tropical forests. By the end of the meeting, it raised at least $6.5bn from governments, although the UK has not yet contributed. Over 90 countries supported a call for a global deforestation action plan, or "roadmap".
