title: Why burnout is a growing problem in cyber-security

When Tony was `signed off` for `burnout` from his `cyber-security` `awareness` role at a major UK ecommerce company last year, it had been a long time coming. "Many of us in cyber, we put our hearts into our job. There's a lot of passion `involved`." He had found it `progressively` harder to sleep, and to go into the office.  

Tony, who did not want his real name used, `recalls` the `Wannacry` `ransomware` attack in 2017. "It was a Friday and something came up on BBC News." The security team got on a call that evening and the decision was taken to remove every single `device` from the network. "And it was Sunday afternoon that I came offline," he says. The `firm` hadn't been hit by the bug, he says. "It was all `preparatory` work."  

Tony said this `pattern` is currently being repeated across organizations trying to protect themselves against the Scattered Spider attacks that hit `retailers` and other businesses this year. And, he says, "I can't even imagine what the `folks` at Co-op and M&S have gone through."  

"If you think you might be burning out, you're already on your way there," says Andrew Tillman, `former head` of cyber risk and `assurance` for the UK's Health Security Agency. He says cyber-security can, at times, be "the best job in the world". But when things get bad "it can be a bit of a dangerous place to be". Mr Tillman has `suffered` `bouts` of "burnout" himself through his four years at the agency.  

That stress is `revealing` itself in data collected by ISC2, the membership organisation for cyber-security professionals. Its annual Workforce Study showed a 66% `favourable` job satisfaction rate in 2024, down four percentage points from the previous year. Burnout is a "major issue" for the sector, ISC2's `chief` information security officer Jon France says. He says professionals in the industry are increasingly being asked "`to do more with less`" which only increases stress and job dissatisfaction. "Cyber-professionals rarely work nine to five", he adds, "Even if they do, they remain on call because threat actors don't `adhere` to office hours."  

Part of the issue is that hackers have become more `aggressive`, prepared to target `critical` national infrastructure, or `cripple` health organizations with ransomware. Also, hackers `backed` by nation states are also `accounting` for more attacks, whether to carry out `espionage`, steal IP, spread `misinformation`, or cause disruption, or even `seek` financial gain on their own account. North Korean hackers, for example have become more active and `adept` at using cybercrime. Earlier this year hackers, thought to be working for the North Korean regime, stole $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worth of digital tokens from `crypto` `exchange` ByBit. US officials estimate that half of North Korea's foreign `currency` `acquisition` comes from cyber theft.  

As private and public `sector` organizations have `digitized` more of their operations, the ramifications of a cyber-attack or data `breach` are more severe. Mr Tillman says: "There's always that `conscious` thought about 'if it goes wrong, how could this `impact` the individuals on the street? How could it affect their jobs, their livelihoods?'." Staff `turnover` is `particularly` `pronounced` in `entry` level roles, says Lisa Ackerman, `former` `deputy` chief information security officer (CISO) at GSK, and CISO Council `strategic` lead at `Cybermindz`, a non-profit targeting burnout in cyber security. `Constant` alerts from warning systems might compound the problem, presenting professionals with a `barrage` of data they have to make sense of. This could be a particular issue for the younger professionals in `frontline` roles and security operations centres. But non-frontline roles are not `immune`, says Mr Tillman. Managing risk and ensuring organisations meet `compliance` and `regulatory` `obligations` can be a challenge when other teams are `desperate` to get new applications or services live without considering all the security angles.  

Cybermindz founder Peter Coroneos says cybersecurity workers can be caught in a "`blame culture`" where their successes are "low visibility". This leaves them carrying "a low level of `dread`", he explains. For younger workers this can be damaging, as the human brain is still developing well into the 20s, Mr Coroneos says. "So, if you are `recruiting` people whose brains are not fully `formed` and putting them in high-stress roles, then you are potentially setting them up for long-term problems in terms of their own `cognitive` and emotional `wellbeing`."  

Cybermindz offers a "structured `neural` training `regime`" which `aims` to get subjects back to a sense of `psychological` safety. "If someone's having a `panic` attack, telling them to just calm down isn't actually going to work. You need to address `neurochemistry`," says Mr Coroneos. `Ultimately`, says Mrs Ackerman, "We want to get to some kind of `legislation` for cyber teams like we have for air traffic controllers and doctors and pilots and people who are first `responders`. Which, in reality, cyber defenders are."  

`In the meantime`, it's down to organizations and workers to watch out for the signs of stress before they turn into something more `ominous`. Mr Tillman says he is now far more `aware` of the warning signs of `impending` burnout, which for him include changing sleep patterns or eating habits, taking less exercise or not walking the dog. "It's almost like a `cyber-breach`," he explains. "You should assume it's on its way and work towards not allowing it to happen."
