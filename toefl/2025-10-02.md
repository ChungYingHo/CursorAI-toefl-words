The first named UK storm of the season – Storm Amy – is expected to bring heavy rain and strong winds when it hits the UK on Friday and Saturday.  
The Met Office has issued an amber severe weather warning for strong winds across western and northern Scotland from Friday evening until Saturday morning.  
Yellow severe weather warnings for wind and rain are also in place across much of the UK between midday on Friday and midnight on Saturday.  

## Before the Storm
- Secure loose objects outside (bins, ladders, trampolines, garden furniture, tools).  
- Check fences and roof tiles are secure.  
- Clear guttering of debris.  
- Remove loose or overhanging branches.  
- Close and fasten doors and windows; secure shutters if fitted.  
- Park vehicles in garages or away from trees/fences.  
- Close and secure loft trapdoors.  
- Know how to turn off gas, electricity, and water.  
- Charge phones, battery packs, and critical devices.  
- Gather essential documents and insurance details.  
- Ensure medication supply for a few days.  
- If in flood-risk area, move valuables upstairs or higher.  

## During the Storm
- Stay inside as much as possible and keep internal doors closed.  
- Unplug non-essential electrical items (power surge risk).  
- Avoid walking near buildings, trees, walls, or fences.  
- Do not attempt repairs while the storm is in progress.  
- Bring animals inside; prepare food, bedding, and water.  
- Listen for warnings on local radio/TV, check government updates.  
- If trapped by floodwater: go to the highest level, avoid attic spaces, roof only if necessary, call 999.  

## Power Cut
- Switch off non-essential appliances, leave one light on.  
- Report power cuts online or by calling 105 (free in UK).  
- Priority list available if you rely on medical equipment.  
- If you smell gas, call 0800 111 999 immediately.  

## Driving
- Avoid driving unless absolutely necessary.  
- Do not use flooded or exposed routes (bridges, high roads).  
- Carry essentials: warm clothes, food, blankets, torch, phone.  
- Drive slowly, be cautious around high-sided vehicles.  
- Give extra space, use headlights or fog lights in poor visibility.  
- Insurance is valid but claims may be harder if driving against advice.  

## After the Storm
- Do not risk your safety; watch for exposed cables.  
- Return home/business only when safe.  
- Contact your insurer quickly (24h helplines available).  
- Make temporary repairs if needed, keep receipts.  
- Do not throw away damaged items unless advised by insurer.  
- Drying a property after flooding can take weeks or months.  

## Misconceptions
- Many believe homeowners are always responsible for fences on the left.  
- In fact, no general rule exists — check property title deeds.
