`A Corn Exchange` is celebrating its 150th anniversary by remembering its `transformation` from a Victorian `trading` `hall` into a performance `venue`. The Cambridge building, which opened in 1875, has `hosted` Sir Winston Churchill, who spoke there to call for `conscription` ahead of World War II; `orchestral` concerts and rock stars including The Who and David Bowie. Rosie Amos, `heritage` project manager, said while `sifting` through old paperwork, they discovered that Rolls-Royce co-founder Charles Rolls rode his first motorbike there.

For its anniversary, the venue, which does not have its own `archive`, was given a `grant` by the National Lottery Heritage Fund to `uncover` the history behind the building. Researchers have explored the Cambridgeshire Collection and Museum of Cambridge, and the Parson's Court `basement`. They also invited the public to share memories made within the 250,000 `bricks` of the building. The research project will end in a special exhibition at the Corn Exchange in February 2026.

"This has been a building that's been part of the Cambridge community - a `hub` - for 150 years, and we're just getting that chance to uncover their history about it now," said Ms Amos. As part of the celebrations, a `backstage` `mural` has been extended. The painting highlighted milestones such as the building's original opening in 1842, its `reconstruction` in 1875, its `post-war` use for concerts, roller skating and `wrestling`, and the arrival of rock 'n' roll.

Tom Thurbon, general manager, added that the Corn Exchange had always adapted to the times, and was currently in a `transition period`. "Economically, venues are being hit quite hard, as well as touring parties," he said. "So trying to make it more accessible and easier for people to tour into is one of our main priorities. At the moment, we're really focusing on `net zero` and trying to get as close to net zero as we possibly can. Obviously, we're a 150-year-old venue, so that's quite `tricky`." He added that "balancing heritage with innovation is really tricky," especially with a venue that was not purpose built.

Recent upgrades include a `refurbished` bar, new seats across the `auditorium`, a `cinema-quality` projector, and improved `lighting` and technology. The site is also part of Cambridge City `Council's` Civic Quarter `revamp, which will see the Guildhall, Corn Exchange and Market Square refurbished.

The city council's `Labour` `cabinet` member for culture, economy and skills, Antoinette Nestor, said: "The whole Corn Exchange has had, through history, a lot of change and a lot of `debate`. When you look back, all the changes have been for the better. So bring it forward, what's going to happen as part of the Civic Quarter is not just for now... but so in 100 and 200 years, we're going to have a place that has been `futureproofed`, and that's what's key."

The Cambridge Corn Exchange is celebrating its 150th anniversary, marking its evolution from a Victorian trading hall into a major performance venue. Over the years, it has hosted historic figures like Winston Churchill and artists such as The Who and David Bowie.  
To commemorate the milestone, the venue received a National Lottery Heritage Fund grant to research and uncover its history, involving local archives and public memories. The project will culminate in an exhibition in 2026.  
Today, the Corn Exchange continues to balance heritage preservation with modern innovation. Recent upgrades include new seating, lighting, and a refurbished bar, while efforts focus on sustainability and achieving net-zero emissions. City officials view these restorations as part of Cambridge’s Civic Quarter revamp, ensuring the building remains a cultural hub for centuries to come.

劍橋的 Corn Exchange 迎來 150 週年，從十九世紀的穀物交易廳蛻變為城市重要的表演場地。多年來曾接待過邱吉爾等歷史人物，以及 The Who、David Bowie 等搖滾巨星。  
為慶祝這一里程碑，場館獲得國家樂透文化基金的補助，用於研究並重現其歷史，包含檔案調查與蒐集市民回憶，最終將於 2026 年舉辦特展。  
如今 Corn Exchange 致力於在文化傳承與現代創新間取得平衡，近期翻修了座位、燈光與酒吧設備，並推動永續發展與「淨零排放」目標。這些工程是劍橋市「市政文化區更新計畫」的一部分，期望讓這座歷史建築繼續成為未來世代的文化中心。
