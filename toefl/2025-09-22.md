Animal `welfare` `activists` in India are `mourning` the death of a `much-loved` elephant they long `sought` to `rehabilitate`. Shankar, the lone African elephant at Delhi's zoo who spent much of his life in `isolation`, `refused` food on Wednesday and `collapsed` by evening. Despite `veterinary` efforts, the 29-year-old male died within 40 minutes, officials said. For 24 years, Shankar `endured` a lonely existence - including at least 13 spent in `solitary` `confinement`. The cause of his death is not known yet. "`Investigation` `regarding` the cause of death `has been ordered`," zoo director Sanjeet Kumar told BBC.

Shankar was among two African elephants that arrived in India in 1998 as a `diplomatic` gift from `Zimbabwe` to `former` India President Shankar Dayal Sharma. But Shankar's `companion` died in 2001, said Mr Kumar. A former zoo official, who did not wish to be identified, said that after his companion's death, Shankar was `temporarily` `lodged` with the Asian elephants in the zoo, but the plan did not work. "They were very `aggressive` towards one another," he said, adding that Shankar was soon isolated. "He Shankar was `playful` when his companion was there. They were popular among zoo visitors. Shankar's behaviour changed after the other African elephant died. Shankar never accepted any other elephant's company, neither did they accept Shankar's. He was left friendless," the former official said. In 2012, Shankar was shifted to a new enclosure that left him `virtually` in solitary confinement - despite a 2009 `federal` `ban` on keeping elephants alone for more than six months. He `remained` there until his death.

For years now, activists have been `demanding` that Shankar be removed from the zoo and rehabilitated in a wildlife `sanctuary` that `houses` other African elephants. In 2021, a `petition` in Delhi's `high court` sought Shankar's relocation to a sanctuary with other African elephants. Two years later, the court `dismissed` the petition, directing the `petitioner` to `approach` the `committee` handling transfers of wild animals by zoos. Until Wednesday, Shankar was among the only two African elephants in India's zoos. The other - also an adult male - lives in Mysore zoo in the southern state of Karnataka. Zoos have long struggled to find mates for the two African male elephants, with efforts `stalled by` high costs, `regulatory` `hurdles`, multiple approvals, and welfare `concerns`, The `Indian Express` reported.

Activists have also `criticised` the conditions in which Shankar was kept at the zoo in Delhi, describing his enclosure as `bleak` and `inadequate`. "It's heartbreaking to see him die like this," said Nikita Dhawan, founder of the non-profit `Youth For Animals`, who had `filed` the 2021 court petition. "It was easily preventable. He (Shankar) did not have any serious health problems. And he was too young." The average life `expectancy` of African elephants is 70 years. Mr Kumar, the director of Delhi zoo, said that there was "no report of sickness or `abnormal` behaviour" in Shankar's case till Wednesday morning. Animal welfare activist Gauri Maulekhi said Shankar's death reflects "years of `institutional` `apathy` and `neglect`" and called it a systemic failure `demanding` `accountability`. "An internal `inquiry` is `simply` not enough," Ms Maulekhi told BBC. "This was a systemic failure that demands real accountability and must serve as a `watershed` moment to end the `cruel` practice of keeping elephants and other social animals isolated in our zoos for good." Asked about `allegations` of neglect, Mr Kumar said "all care and `upkeep` was followed", but `declined` to take specific questions.

In October 2024, `the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums`, `suspended` the Delhi zoo's membership `over concerns` about Shankar's living conditions, following reports that he was `chained`, news `agency` PTI reported. `The global body` gave Delhi zoo until April 2025 to either relocate Shankar or improve his care, warning that its membership would be `terminated` if the deadline was missed. A day after the `suspension` notice, a federal `minister` `inspected` Shankar's enclosure and said his health looked better. On 15 October, the government announced plans to bring him a female companion, saying Zimbabwe and Botswana had shown interest and `formalities` were `underway`. Officials in Delhi zoo said that they did not receive any more notices from the global body. And Shankar died before a companion could be `arranged`.

:::note
1. 關係子句修飾名詞  
Shankar, the lone African elephant at Delhi's zoo who spent much of his life in isolation, refused food...  
👉 常見考點：抓主幹句，去掉修飾語才能讀懂。主幹距其實是後面在說明 Shankar 拒食，前面這些都是修飾。

2. 被動語態  
"Investigation regarding the cause of death has been ordered," zoo director Sanjeet Kumar told BBC.  
👉 托福常考誰是執行者？以這裡來講，執行下達命令動作的人不會是動物原，所以答案應該往政府或動物園上級思考。

3. 讓步/對比結構  
...left him virtually in solitary confinement — despite a 2009 federal ban on keeping elephants alone...  
👉 despite / although / even though 常是訊號詞。

4. 片語 be stalled by  
Zoos have long struggled to find mates... with efforts stalled by high costs, regulatory hurdles...  
👉 托福愛考動詞片語 + 被動。

5. 名詞片語做主語  
Animal welfare activist Gauri Maulekhi said Shankar's death reflects "years of institutional apathy and neglect".  
👉 名詞堆疊，重點是找到核心名詞 (reflects neglect)。
