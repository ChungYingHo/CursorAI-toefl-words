title: Car blueprints turned into contemporary art

Hundreds of blueprints of old Land Rover, Triumph and Mini vehicles have been saved from the `shredder` and turned into `contemporary` artwork. French artist Alan Reullier has used the drawings, originally kept in the British Motor Museum `archives` before being stored, to create pop art pieces celebrating the West Midlands region's motoring legacy. The drawings were left `languishing` in storage for 20 years and most were `ultimately` going to be `dumped` before Reuiller managed to save as many as he could, his `agent` Edwina Lightfoot said. A free `exhibition` of the `reworked` pieces opens at the Courtyard Gallery, Solihull, on 5 November.

Up to 20 pieces will be on display. The rare blueprints, which also include Leyland and MG models, were collected from the museum in Gaydon, Warwickshire, about two decades ago by British Motor Heritage. They were kept in a basic storage `facility` and over time began to `rot` and degrade, with many ready to be thrown away and `shredded` until the unit was reopened and the company set about preserving them, Ms Lightfoot said.

Reullier, an industrial artist who has worked with `aerospace` firms, became aware that they may be lost and was allowed to `retrieve` what he could to use in his art and collaborate with the company. "He's combining his artwork with the history of the `Midlands` motor industry and now people can own that," she added.

The former `graffiti` artist and French aircraft `mechanic` has added `bold` `patterns` and `colours` around the prints with his signature black-and-white `motifs`, according to the gallery. "I've worked with the history and spent countless hours researching stories," Reullier said. "It's an `honour` to collaborate with British Motor Heritage and contribute my artistic vision to their legacy. I'm inspired by the chance to push the `boundaries` of `automotive` design and create something unique that `resonates` with all audiences."

**English & Chinese Summary**

Hundreds of blueprints of classic British cars such as Land Rover, Triumph, and Mini were rescued from destruction and transformed into modern art. French artist Alan Reullier used the original drawings—once stored and forgotten in the British Motor Museum archives—to create colourful pop art pieces celebrating the West Midlands’ automotive heritage.  

數百份英國經典汽車（如 Land Rover、Triumph、Mini）的藍圖被從銷毀堆中搶救出來，並化為現代藝術作品。法國藝術家艾倫・雷利耶（Alan Reullier）將這些曾長期被遺忘於英國汽車博物館檔案館的設計圖，改造成色彩鮮明的波普藝術，致敬英國中部地區的汽車傳統。  

The blueprints had been neglected for two decades before Reullier and his agent saved them. With permission from British Motor Heritage, he retrieved and reworked the fragile documents into about twenty artworks now exhibited in Solihull.  

這些藍圖被忽視長達二十年，直到雷利耶與經紀人設法拯救並取得使用許可，重新創作出約二十件作品，目前於索利哈爾展出。  

Formerly a graffiti artist and aircraft mechanic, Reullier added bold patterns and colours to merge industrial history with contemporary creativity. He described the project as an honour and a chance to push the boundaries of automotive design while ensuring that Britain’s motor legacy continues to resonate with modern audiences.  

曾為塗鴉藝術家與飛機技師的雷利耶，以鮮明圖案與色彩重塑工業歷史，將藝術與汽車設計融合。他表示，能參與這項計畫是榮幸，也希望藉此突破汽車設計的界限，讓英國汽車文化在當代重新共鳴。
