title: Volcanic eruption may have triggered Europe's deadly Black Death plague

A volcanic eruption around the year 1345 may have `set off` a chain reaction that `unleashed` Europe's `deadliest` pandemic, the Black Death, scientists say. Clues preserved in tree rings suggest the eruption triggered a climate shock and led to `a string of events` that brought the disease to medieval Europe. Under this scenario, the ash and gases from a volcanic eruption caused extreme drops in temperature and led to poor harvests.

To `avert` `famine`, populous Italian city states were `forced` to import grain from areas around the Black Sea - bringing `plague-carrying` `fleas` that carried the disease to Europe as well. This "perfect storm" of a climate shock, famine and trade `offers a reminder` of how diseases can `emerge` and spread in a globalised and warmer world, according to `experts`.

"Although the `coincidence` of factors that contributed to the Black Death seems rare, the `probability` of `zoonotic` diseases emerging under climate change and translating into pandemics is likely to increase in a globalised world," said Dr Ulf Büntgen of the University of Cambridge. He added: "This is especially `relevant` given our recent experiences with Covid-19."

The Black Death swept across Europe in 1348-49, killing up to half of the population. The disease was caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia `pestis` spread by wild `rodents`, such as rats, and fleas. The `outbreak` is believed to have started in Central Asia, moving around the world through trade. But the `precise` `sequence` of events that brought the disease to Europe - killing millions of people – has been `pored` over by scholars.

Now researchers from the University of Cambridge and the Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe (GWZO) in Leipzig have `filled in` a missing part of the puzzle. They used clues from tree rings and ice cores to `examine` climatic conditions at the time of the Black Death.

Their evidence suggests that volcanic activity around 1345 caused temperatures to drop sharply over `consecutive` years because of the release of volcanic ash and gases which blocked out some sunlight. This in turn caused crops to fail across the `Mediterranean` region. To avoid `starvation`, Italian city states traded with grain producers around the Black Sea, `unwittingly` enabling the deadly bacterium to gain a `foothold` in Europe.

Dr Martin Bauch, a historian of `medieval` climate and `epidemiology` from GWZO, said climatic events met a "complicated system of food security" in what amounted to a "perfect storm". "For more than a century, these powerful Italian city states had established long-distance trade routes across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, allowing them to activate a highly efficient system to prevent starvation," he said. "But ultimately, these would `inadvertently` lead to a far bigger `catastrophe`."
