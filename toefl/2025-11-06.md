Popular `forum` site Reddit has been added to Australia's world-first social media ban for children under 16 that starts next month. Live-streaming platform Kick will also be included, bringing the number of sites targeted in the ban to nine. They include Facebook, X, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Threads.

From 10 December, tech companies can be `fined` up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take "`reasonable` steps" to `deactivate` existing accounts for under-16s and prohibit new ones. Each banned platform was chosen as their "`sole` or a significant `purpose` is to enable online social interaction," the government said, and more sites may be added given the "fast-changing" nature of technology.

"Delaying children's access to social media accounts gives them valuable time to learn and grow, free of the powerful, unseen `forces` of harmful and `deceptive` design features such as `opaque` algorithms and endless scroll," said Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant.

Messaging services Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms Lego Play and Roblox will not be included, nor will Google Classroom and YouTube Kids. Federal Communications Minister Anika Wells said the online platforms can target children with "`chilling` control" and the ban was about protecting children. "We aren't `chasing` `perfection`, we are chasing a meaningful difference," she said.

It is unclear how companies will implement the ban - which is being closely watched by global leaders - but some of the potential methods include using official ID documents, parental approval and facial recognition technology. Critics have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification software, with a recent report showing the proposed methods all have risks or `shortcomings`.

Most Australian adults support the ban, according to `polls`, but some mental health `advocates` say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to `even-less-regulated` corners of the internet. Instead, they say, the government should focus on better policing of harmful content on social media platforms and prepare children for the reality of life on the web.

An Australian influencer family who have millions of YouTube followers recently announced their decision to move to the UK to avoid the upcoming ban, namely so their 14-year-old daughter can continue to create online content. YouTube was initially `exempt` from the ban but in July, the government reversed its decision, saying the video sharing site was "the most frequently `cited` platform" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw "harmful content". Teens under 16 will still be able to view YouTube videos but will not be permitted to have an account, which is required for uploading content or interacting on the platform.

### English Summary  
Australia will introduce a world-first social media ban for children under 16 starting in December. The new law includes platforms such as Reddit, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. Companies that fail to deactivate underage accounts or prevent new ones may face fines of up to A$50 million. The government says the goal is to protect children from harmful algorithms and addictive design features.  

Messaging apps like Discord and WhatsApp and gaming platforms like Roblox are excluded. Officials emphasize they are not chasing perfection but aiming for meaningful change. However, experts warn of privacy risks in age verification systems like facial recognition.  

Polls show most Australians support the ban, though some mental health advocates fear it could isolate young people or push them to less regulated online spaces. An influencer family even announced plans to move to the UK so their 14-year-old daughter can continue creating content on YouTube.  

### 中文摘要  
澳洲將於十二月起實施全球首例「禁止 16 歲以下使用社群媒體」的新法，涵蓋 Reddit、Facebook、TikTok、Instagram 和 YouTube 等平台。若企業未停用未成年帳號或防止其註冊，最高可被罰五千萬澳元。政府表示，這項措施旨在保護兒童免受有害演算法與成癮性設計的影響。  

Discord、WhatsApp 等通訊軟體及 Roblox 等遊戲平台不在禁令範圍內。官員強調，他們追求的不是完美，而是有意義的改變。不過，專家警告，臉部辨識等年齡驗證系統可能帶來隱私風險。  

民調顯示，多數澳洲人支持禁令，但心理健康倡議者擔心，這可能讓青少年更加孤立，或轉向監管更少的網路角落。一個知名網紅家庭甚至宣布將搬到英國，以讓他們 14 歲的女兒能繼續經營 YouTube 頻道。
