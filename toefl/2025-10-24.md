A new event is set to take place next year in Hull designed to be a "huge celebration of local `identity`". Our City will be held in March and `feature` two city centre `parades` which will end in Queen Victoria Square. The arts organisation Back to Ours has been `awarded` a `contract` from Hull City `Council` to develop the event. CEO and artistic director of Back to Ours, Louise Yates, said from next week, the group will visit different areas in Hull to "collect responses to three prompts that will help `shape` the look and feel of the event".

Hull City Council said the event would "form part of a fantastic weekend" `alongside` Colliderfest, a science and arts festival and Cultural Tides, an annual `conference` that shapes the culture in the city. It will bring community groups and organisations together, the organisation said.

Councillor Rob Pritchard, `portfolio` holder for culture and leisure, said: "Our City will bring culture from communities across Hull, right into the heart of it. Back to Ours are `renowned` for their gift of engaging communities and offering unique and exciting opportunities to experience art in culture across our neighbourhoods, so I can't think of anyone better to `deliver` this new event."

Ms Yates added: "Our City is a huge celebration of local identity, made with and for the people of Hull. It celebrates our location by the water, too – the idea of `waves` of activity moving from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, connecting communities and building into the `large-scale` city centre event."
