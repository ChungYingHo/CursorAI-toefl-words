A deal aimed at ending the US government `shutdown` has passed the `Senate`, `paving` the way for the `record-breaking` `impasse` to be broken. After a weekend of `negotiations` in Washington, a `minority` of Democrats joined with Republicans and voted in `favour` of an agreement. The vote is a `procedural` first step towards passing a `compromise` to fund the government since it ran out of money 1 October. It will need to clear several more `hurdles` - including a vote from the House of Representatives - before federal employees and services return, but it is the first serious sign of progress after 40 days of `deadlock`. The Senate is expected to return for further `debate` at 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Monday. The current shutdown is the longest on record in the US, and until this weekend it appeared that Republican and Democratic lawmakers were locked in a `stalemate`.

Many government services have been suspended since October, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay. The shutdown has had wide ranging impacts on a variety of services, including US air travel and food benefits for 41 million low-income Americans. The `agreement` was `negotiated` between Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House, with Democratic `senators` Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Angus King of Maine, an independent who `caucuses` with the Democrats. Republicans - who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate - needed the measure to clear a 60-vote minimum threshold. They were able attract eight votes from the other side of the `aisle`, while losing just one in Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who voted against after saying the bill would increase national `debt`.

The deal includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare `subsidies` that are due to expire this year, a key issue Democrats had been `holding out` for `concessions` on. Democratic Party leaders had said that they would not `lend` their support to new funding for government operations until Congress `addressed` the subsidies that help tens of millions of Americans pay for health `insurance` purchased through government-run exchanges. "I'm thankful to be able to say we have `senators`, both Democrats and Republicans, who are `eager` to get to work to address that `crisis` in a `bipartisan` way," Senate Majority Leader John Thune said ahead of the vote. "We also have a president who is willing to sit down and get to work on this issue. So I'm looking forward to seeing what solutions might be brought forward."

Thune did not say exactly what that bill would contain, which `frustrated` many Democrats in the House and the Senate, who argued that the Democrats who negotiated the deal did so without getting enough in return. "For months and months Democrats have been fighting to get the Senate to address the healthcare crisis," said Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate. "This bill does nothing to ensure that that crisis is addressed," he said as he confirmed he would vote against the deal. Some `high-profile` Democrats have been highly `critical` of `colleagues` who `sided` with Republicans to end the shutdown without `concrete` `guarantees` on healthcare, with California Governor Gavin Newsom calling the decision "pathetic".

The measure also includes three `appropriations` bills to fund agencies like `veterans` affairs and agriculture, as well as a continuing resolution to finance the rest of the government until 30 January - meaning another government shutdown could be on the horizon early next year. It also includes guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) - an essential food safety net for one in eight Americans - until next September. A vote on the deal would only be the first procedural step in the new funding agreement and it would still need to be approved by the US House of Representatives, where it is likely to see its own challenges.
