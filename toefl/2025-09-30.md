title: Cars to be banned from city centre swivel bridge

A `Grade II-listed` `swivel` bridge will `be closing to` cars under new plans to promote active travel. The Prince Street Bridge on Bristol `harbour` is `crossed by` approximately 24,000 `pedestrians` and cyclists and 1,700 vehicles daily. The bridge is only open to southbound traffic but will become fully `pedestrianised` as part of a £2.3m `scheme` to promote active travel in the city. "With more people travelling `sustainably`, we can cut `congestion`, improve health and `wellbeing`, and support the city's journey toward becoming carbon neutral," said Councillor Ed Plowden, `chair of` the transport and `connectivity` `committee`.

The plans `will also see` 20 more cycle `hangars` installed in the city, an expansion of schemes to create "traffic-free zones" during `pick-up` and `drop-off` times and improved cycle and walking routes towards Temple Quarter. "The A4 Bath Bridges project could include new `infrastructure`, such as a new pedestrian and cycle bridge or bridges between the Three Lamps `junction` and Cattle Market Road," said Mr Plowden.

The money has come from the West of `England Combined Authority` (WECA) who were recently `awarded` more than £4.6m from the Department of Transport to promote more walking and cycling. The `rest` of the `funding` - which includes a further £160,000 from the combined `authority's` `Investment Fund` - will go towards schemes in the wider region. "We all want better, safer walking, `wheeling` and cycling routes across the West for people's everyday journeys," said WECA `mayor` Helen Godwin. "Getting the basics right now by improving our walking and cycling infrastructure, and fixing our roads and bridges, will lay the `foundations` for a better transport system overall for our part of the world," she added.

:::note
The passage talks about a new plan in Bristol. Prince Street Bridge, used by around 24,000 pedestrians and 1,700 vehicles daily, will soon close to cars and become pedestrian and bicycle only. The main goal is to promote active travel, cut congestion, improve health, and move toward carbon neutrality. The plan also includes more cycle hangars, traffic-free zones, and better walking and cycling infrastructure. Funding comes from the West of England Combined Authority and the Department of Transport, with over £4.6m invested. Officials say this lays the foundation for a safer and more sustainable transport system in the future.
