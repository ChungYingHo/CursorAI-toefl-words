title: AI tool helped recover £500m lost to fraud, government says

A new artificial intelligence tool designed to `crack down` on `fraud` has helped the UK government recover almost £500m over the last year, the BBC can `reveal`. More than a third of the money `clawed` back related to `fraudulent` activity during the Covid-19 pandemic, with other cash being `recouped` from `unlawful` `council` tax `claims` and `illegal` `subletting` of social housing. The government will `announce` later that a new AI tool which has helped to identify the fraud will now be licensed to other countries, including the US and Australia. `Civil` `liberties` `campaigners` have `previously` `criticised` the Labour government for its use of AI in trying to counter fraud.

The `Cabinet` Office says the £480m recovered in the 12 months from April 2024 is the largest sum ever `reclaimed` by government `anti-fraud` teams in a single year. The savings have been made by `cross-referencing` information held by different government departments, as well as using a new AI tool. `Ministers` say the savings will now be used to `recruit` nurses, teachers and police officers. Of the total sum recovered, £186m was related to Covid fraud. Ministers have long `vowed` to `claw back` some of the money lost during the pandemic, but the £186m `recouped` is a `fraction` of the amount Labour has previously said was missing. Before last year's general `election`, the `now-Chancellor` Rachel Reeves claimed more than £7bn of public money was lost to fraud during the pandemic.

These savings include the blocking of hundreds of thousands of companies with potentially `fraudulent` `Bounce Back Loans` from `dissolving`. Bounce Back Loans were loans of up to £50,000 set up by the government during the pandemic to support businesses. But the `scheme` has been criticised for not being `diligent` enough and effectively `inviting` fraud, as companies that `dissolve` before paying back the money often then do not need to repay anything. The Cabinet Office says one case it found involved a woman who invented a company and then sent the `loan` money to Poland.

Cabinet Office minister Josh Simons will `announce` the savings at an `anti-fraud` summit held `jointly` by the UK, the US, Canada and Australia on Wednesday. He said "`cutting-edge` AI and data tools" would ensure the government can protect public funds and not "line the pockets of `scammers` and `swindlers`". The new AI tool, called the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, was developed by researchers in the Cabinet Office and will now be `rolled out` across other government departments. The Cabinet Office said the tool "scans new policies and `procedures` for weaknesses before they can be `exploited`" and claims it could make policies "`fraud-proof`" before they are `implemented`. It was developed because of `concern` within Whitehall about the level of fraud seen during the pandemic.

Simons will announce that the UK government will now license the tool for international use, and it is expected that the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand will all adopt it in some way. But the move could cause concern among `campaign` groups already unhappy with the government's use of AI. Last year, an AI tool used to crack down on `welfare` fraud was found to show bias according to people's age, disability, marital status and nationality. Documents released to the Guardian under Freedom of Information Laws admitted the tool used by the Department for Work and Pensions showed a "statistically significant outcome `disparity`" in a "`fairness` analysis". A report by Amnesty International released earlier this year criticised the government's "unchecked use of tech and AI systems".

:::summary
The article talks about how the UK government used a new AI tool to recover nearly £500 million lost to fraud, including money from Covid-19 relief scams, unlawful tax claims, and fake companies.  
The tool, called the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, helps detect weaknesses in policies and identify fraudulent activities by cross-referencing data from different government departments.  
Officials say the recovered funds will help recruit nurses, teachers, and police officers, and the technology will soon be licensed to countries like the US, Canada, and Australia.  
However, civil liberty groups and human rights organizations raised concerns that AI systems used by the government might show bias and lack transparency, as seen in previous welfare fraud detection tools.  
The government insists that the AI helps protect public funds, but critics warn against unchecked use of such technology.

這篇文章講述英國政府如何運用一款新的人工智慧工具追回將近 5 億英鎊的詐欺資金，  
其中包含新冠疫情紓困詐騙、違法稅務申請與假公司貸款等案件。  
這款名為「詐欺風險評估加速器」的工具能夠透過跨部門資料比對，偵測政策漏洞並找出可疑行為。  
政府表示追回的資金將用於招募護士、教師與警察，並計畫將該技術授權給美國、加拿大與澳洲等國。  
不過，公民自由與人權團體對此表示擔憂，指出政府使用的 AI 系統可能存在偏見與透明度不足的問題。  
雖然政府強調這項技術有助於保護公共資金，但批評者警告不應讓此類技術在缺乏監管下被濫用。
