American delivery firms UPS and FedEx have temporarily `grounded` part of their `fleets` of `cargo` planes after a `mid-take-off` crash in Kentucky on Tuesday left at least 14 people dead. The UPS aircraft `burst` into `flames` shortly after `take-off` when it `collided` with neighbouring business `premises`, triggering a huge fire which `gutted` several buildings and closed Louisville International Airport. UPS said the decision to `ground` MD-11 models followed instructions from `manufacturer` Boeing, while `rival` delivery giant FedEx `confirmed` it would follow suit. Officials are yet to determine what caused the deadly crash.

Hours before the fleet was grounded, officials `confirmed` that the death `toll` had risen to 14 after another body was found, with buildings caught up in the fire still being searched for more `victims`. "We pray for each of the victims' families and pray that no additional victims are lost," Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. In a `statement`, UPS said the decision to ground 9% of its fleet was out of an "`abundance` of caution". Boeing later said in a statement to Reuters that it recommended UPS and FedEx `suspend` use of the MD-11 plane. "This recommendation was made in an abundance of caution and we will continue `coordinating` with the FAA on this matter," a Boeing spokesperson said.

It is unclear to what `extent` delivery services will be `impacted` by the moves from UPS and FedEx, which are the world's largest `cargo` carriers. FedEx said it operated 28 MD-11s and Reuters `quoted` a UPS `factsheet` that said the firm had 27 in its fleet before the Kentucky crash. UPS said `contingency` plans were in place to continue service. A statement continued: "Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve."

The model of aircraft involved in the crash was a MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006. MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997. Production of MD-11 planes ended in 2000, while passenger service `officially` ended in 2014. According to the National Transportation and Safety Board, the left engine caught fire and `detached` from the wing during take-off. The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it took off for a long flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire after the crash.
