PlayStation fans and PlayStation haters don't usually agree. But there's one `complaint` (or `insult`, depending on who you ask) that's been coming from both sides. "Where are all the games?" `Big-budget`, single-player `blockbusters` from `in-house` studios have been the key to Sony's console success. In the PlayStation 4 days fans got a `steady` `stream` of `cinematic` adventures, but that's felt more like a `trickle` since 2023's Spider-Man 2. However, Sony's newest release - Ghost of Yōtei - is a return to its `proven` triple-A format. BBC Newsbeat spoke to Nate Fox, a creative director at Sony-owned studio Sucker Punch, about the wait for the game and some of the reasons behind it.  

Firstly, what took so long? Sucker Punch's latest is a follow-up to 2020's `feudal` Japan-set adventure Ghost of Tsushima, one of the last big `PS4-exclusive` releases from Sony. "Games do take a long time to make, so it's no small `chunk` of your life," says Nate. Ghost of Yōtei relocates the action a few hundred miles north, to the Honshū region, and the setting a few hundred years later, to 1603. This time the story follows Atsu, a female `warrior` on a quest to exact revenge against the Yōtei Six - a group of `warlords` responsible for her family's murder. With a previous game to build on, it's not a completely fresh start but, Nate explains, the project is still a huge undertaking. Just having a new main character, for example, requires input from writers, animators and character designers, to name just a few of the roles involved. Behind the scenes there are many, many more.  

Although Sucker Punch has `roughly` 200 employees at its base near Seattle, many hundreds more work on its games. The credits for Ghost of Tsushima, for example, contained about 1,800 names. Some of those will be from abroad, or from outside companies that `specialise` in certain technical fields. "Making a video game requires all sorts of different skills, from incredibly technical people... to people who are very driven by emotions, like our writing staff," says Nate. "And these teams work in `co-ordination`. It's like conducting an `orchestra`. You need to have all of the elements coming together." Nate says that a `dizzying` number of elements can go into a single scene - from music to the programming that makes leaves blow across the screen at a `pivotal` moment. "All these teams have to have a sense of where they're going," says Nate.  

A sense of direction is something fans have accused PlayStation of lacking in the last few years. Under its previous boss, Jim Ryan, the `division` `launched` development on 12 online multiplayer titles, known as "`live-service`" games in the industry. Some of the most famous examples, such as Fortnite, Roblox and Call of Duty, keep players `engaged` for months and generate huge amounts of money. Sony has had success in the space with last year's Helldivers II, but a `disastrous` failure with Concord, which was taken offline just two weeks after its release. It has since cancelled multiplayer projects based on some of its most popular series, including God of War and The Last of Us. `Pursuing` the multiplayer market is a strategy Sony has `admitted` is not entirely "going smoothly", but it's said some titles with online elements, such as Gran Turismo and baseball game MLB: The Show, have performed well. The stars of its most recent `promotional` `showcase` were Saros, a follow-up to 2021's Returnal, and the long-awaited Wolverine game from Spider-Man maker Insomniac - both single-player games.  

`High-profile` releases can be magnets for `controversy`, as Sucker Punch recently found when a developer's joke about the death of `right-wing` American `activist` Charlie Kirk prompted a backlash. The studio `eventually` fired the employee involved, and founder Brian Fleming told journalist Stephen Totilo that "celebrating or making light of someone's murder is a `deal-breaker` for us", when asked about it. Some right-wing video game influencers have also attacked Ghost of Yōtei for featuring a female `protagonist`. Nate says it was an "`unconventional` choice", but key to the story the developers wanted to tell of an `underdog` `defying` society's expectations. As the game progresses, Atsu's `reputation` as an Onryō - a `vengeful` spirit found in Japanese `folklore` - grows. "People think there's no way this woman could have taken out members of the Yōtei Six unless she is a `supernatural` creature," says Nate.  

Big releases can also invite another kind of `scrutiny` - `hype`. With the gap between new games widening, it puts pressure on developers to deliver something that will `impress` fans. How do you `cope`? "Certainly there's a lot of expectation that games will be beautiful and emotionally `compelling`," says Nate. "And that pressure definitely gets us going, but it's nothing compared to the pressure we put on ourselves."

這篇文章討論 Sony 與旗下工作室 Sucker Punch 的新作《Ghost of Yōtei》，以及 PlayStation 近期遊戲策略與爭議。  

- 背景  
PlayStation 粉絲與批評者都抱怨遊戲太少：「Where are all the games?」  
PS4 時代有穩定的作品輸出，但自 2023 年《Spider-Man 2》後僅有零星大作。  

- 遊戲開發  
《Ghost of Yōtei》是《Ghost of Tsushima》的續作，設定在 1603 年。

Nate Fox 說：「Games do take a long time to make, so it's no small chunk of your life.」  
遊戲製作需要數百人協作，他形容：「It's like conducting an orchestra.」  

- Sony 策略  
前總裁 Jim Ryan 推出 12 款多人「live-service」遊戲，但有成功（Helldivers II）、也有失敗（Concord）。  
Sony 取消了一些多人計畫，但強調 Gran Turismo 等作品仍有表現。  
近期展示的重點仍是單人遊戲，如《Saros》《Wolverine》。  

- 爭議  
開發人員因一則關於右翼人士的玩笑被解雇，創辦人回應：「Celebrating or making light of someone's murder is a deal-breaker for us.」  
部分評論者攻擊女主角設定，Nate 回應這是「unconventional choice」，故事主題是「an underdog defying society's expectations」。  

- 挑戰與壓力  
大作間的間隔拉長，開發者承受更多期待。Nate 說：「Certainly there's a lot of expectation that games will be beautiful and emotionally compelling... but it's nothing compared to the pressure we put on ourselves.」
