OpenAI has signed a $38bn (£29bn) `contract` with Amazon to access its cloud computing infrastructure, as the `start-up` continues its run of major partnerships to secure computing power. In 2025, the ChatGPT maker has signed `deals` worth more than $1tn with Oracle, Broadcom, AMD and `chip-making` giant Nvidia. Its latest deal reduces its `reliance` on Microsoft. As part of the seven-year agreement, OpenAI will `gain` `access to` Nvidia graphics `processors` to train its artificial intelligence models. The deal follows a `sweeping` restructure of OpenAI last week which saw it convert away from being a non-profit and changed its relationship with Microsoft to give OpenAI more operational and financial freedom.

"`Scaling` `frontier` AI requires `massive`, reliable compute," said OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman. "Our partnership with AWS Amazon Web Services `strengthens` the broad compute ecosystem that will power this next `era` and bring advanced AI to everyone." The deal reflects the massive `demand` for computer power coming from the growing interest in AI - and OpenAI's `rush to` `secure` the power it needs. OpenAI, which brought AI into the `consumer` `mainstream` with the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, had been reliant on Microsoft for computing power for years. The two firms had an exclusive cloud agreement until January of this year, when their relationship `loosened`.

The AI start-up's first agreement with Amazon's AWS marks its latest `shift away` from Microsoft toward diversified sources of computing power. "The deal with AWS shows that OpenAI considers that its `path` to leadership is `paved` with `getting access` to as much computing power as it can get its `hands on`," said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Microsoft "taking less of a control `stake` in the company has allowed relationships with near competitors to OpenAI's funders possible," she added. But OpenAI has been unprofitable, as it spends big to get ahead in the development of AI technology. `Quarterly` results from Microsoft last week indicated that OpenAI lost $12bn in just the last quarter.

Following the `announcement` of the deal on Monday, Amazon shares `hit` an all-time high, adding $140bn (£106bn) to its `valuation`. AWS is "uniquely positioned to support OpenAI's `vast` AI `workloads`," Matt Garman, CEO of AWS, said in a statement. Leading AI firms have been investing in one another, creating a `tangled` web of deals that has been drawing `scrutiny`. OpenAI is at the centre of that web. In response to OpenAI's deal `spree`, there has been some `speculation` that an AI `bubble` may be in the `offing`. Speaking to the BBC last month, Sam Altman said: "Yes, the investment `loans` are `unprecedented`," but added: "It's also unprecedented for companies to be growing revenue this fast." Warnings have come from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, as well as from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who told the BBC that "the level of `uncertainty` should be higher in most people's minds."

:::summary
OpenAI will end the relationship with Microsoft and start the other relationship with Amazon in the future.  
The decision was due to OpenAI need more freedom to develop the artificial intelligence and also Amazon is a huge company in computer technology, which can also support OpenAI to be the leader in AI development.  
Due to OpenAI didn't earn money in last quarter, some investment were worry about this decision.

修正：
OpenAI will end its partnership with Microsoft and start a new one with Amazon in the future.
The decision was made because OpenAI needs more freedom to develop artificial intelligence, and Amazon, being a huge company in computer technology, can also support OpenAI in becoming a leader in AI development.
Since OpenAI did not make a profit last quarter, some investors are worried about this decision.
