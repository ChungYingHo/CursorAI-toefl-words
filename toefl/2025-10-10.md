A new law in California is `aimed` at stopping advertisements from pumping up the `volume` on `streaming services`. The law, which says `adverts` cannot be louder than the primary video content being watched, builds on a `federal` one that sets the volume of ads on broadcast TV and `cable` stations to include streaming platforms. `Opponents`, including the `influential` entertainment industry, had argued it would be difficult to implement because streaming services do not have the same control over ad volume as broadcasters. California is home to the `headquarters` of streaming platforms Netflix and Hulu, and Amazon produces many of its Prime Video shows and movies there.

In 2010, `Congress` pass the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act to `dial down` the volume on TV and radio stations. The law that California Governor Gavin Newsom signed on Monday forces streaming services to `comply` with the Obama-era federal law too. The services were in their `nascence` when the CALM Act was passed but have since become the primary viewing option in many US households. "We heard Californians loud and clear, and what's clear is that they don't want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program," Newsom said upon signing the bill.

Existing federal law requires the federal `regulator`, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to develop `regulations` that require `commercials` to have the same average volume as the programs they accompany, according to the bill. In February, the FCC said it had received thousands of complaints about loud commercials over past several years - many `regarding` streaming services. This law, which takes effect on and after July 1, 2026, `prohibits` a video streaming service that serves consumers in the state from `transmitting` the audio of commercial advertisements louder than the video content the people are watching.

"This bill was `inspired` by baby Samantha and every exhausted parent who's finally gotten a baby to sleep, only to have a `blaring` streaming ad `undo` all that hard work," said State Senator Thomas Umberg, who introduced the bill. Samantha is the daughter of Umberg's `legislative` `director`, Zach Keller, who told him about a noisy ad waking up his infant daughter while he was watching a streaming show.

However, the Motion Picture Association and the Streaming Innovation Alliance, which represent streaming services including Disney and Netflix, initially `opposed` the bill. They said they do not have the ability to control volume settings on the devices on which their content is `offered`, unlike broadcast and `cable TV` providers. Streaming ads come from several different sources and cannot necessarily or `practically` be controlled, the MPA's `vice-president` of state government affairs Melissa Patack said in June.

The bill was later `amended with` a legal `provision` that would `bar` individuals or private parties from `suing` streaming services for violating the law. Both groups remained neutral on the amended bill as a result, according to the Los Angeles Times.

This article talks about a new law in California that stops streaming services from playing loud advertisements.  
The law says ads cannot be louder than the main video, expanding an older federal rule called the CALM Act.  
Many people support it, especially parents tired of noisy ads, but streaming companies like Netflix and Disney said it’s hard to control the volume on different devices.  
The bill was later changed to prevent people from suing the platforms, and now it will take effect in 2026.  
Overall, the law aims to make watching streaming shows quieter and more comfortable for everyone.

這篇文章講的是加州新通過的一項法律，禁止串流平台播放比影片更大聲的廣告。  
這項法律擴充了早期的「CALM 法案」，要求廣告音量與主要節目一致。  
許多民眾支持這項法案，尤其是被吵醒的家長們，但像 Netflix 和 Disney 這類串流公司表示，控制不同裝置的音量非常困難。  
後來法案修訂，禁止民眾因違法音量而起訴平台，並預計於 2026 年正式生效。  
整體來說，這項法律希望讓人們在觀看串流節目時更安靜、更舒適。
