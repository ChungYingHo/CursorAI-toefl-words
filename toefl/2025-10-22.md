A collection of David Hockney's iPad drawings of the Yorkshire Wolds have been sold at `auction` for £6.2m. The 17 prints are titled The Arrival of Spring in Woldgate and were started in 2011, six years after Hockney `swapped` Beverly Hills for Bridlington. They went under the `hammer` earlier at Sotheby's in London, selling for more than double the estimate for the collection. Sotheby's said it was the largest group of Hockney's iPad drawings to come to market and described it as an "`exceptionally` rare opportunity" for buyers.

The 17 works came from a private collection and the sale `coincided` with the Frieze art `fair`. Since creating the first drawing in January 2011, Hockney, who is now 88, returned daily to different spots in Woldgate, continuing the series through to spring.

He had planned to paint at a `plein` air `easel` but realised it was a "bit difficult when you are stood there in the winter", and turned to his iPad to `fulfil` the project, Sotheby's said. The full series was then `unveiled` as part of an `exhibition` at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2012.

Hockney was `brought up` in Bradford but spent a lot of summers during his school holidays `stocking` corn in East Yorkshire. During the 1990s, he visited Yorkshire more frequently to visit his mother, and later when his close friend, Jonathan Silver, was `diagnosed` with cancer.

修改說明
- **"drawing" → "drawings"**：因為是多幅作品，要用複數。  
- **句型調整**："A collection of 17 iPad drawings by David Hockney" 比 "A collection of Hockney's iPad drawing" 更自然。  
- **"drawed" → "drew"**：動詞不規則變化。  
- **"due to it was difficult to draw in outside"** → 改成 **"because it was difficult to paint outdoors"**，語法與搭配更自然。  
- **"used 6 years to finish"** → 原意應是「六年後開始創作」，所以改為 **"six years after he moved from Beverly Hills to Bridlington."**。
