Google's parent company Alphabet will invest $15bn (£11.29bn) to build an AI data `hub` in southern India's Andhra Pradesh state. The `facility`, which will be set up in the `port` city of Visakhapatnam, will be part of Google's global network of AI centres spread across 12 countries. "It's the largest AI hub that we are going to be investing in anywhere in the world, outside of the United States," Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, said at an event in the capital Delhi on Tuesday, adding that the investment will be spread over the next five years. The `announcement` comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has been asking American companies to `prioritise` `domestic` investment.

India has `emerged` as a key `destination` for AI data centres. The country's low data costs and rapidly growing internet user base have made it a hub for cloud and AI expansion for `tech giants`. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the facility "will bring our industry-leading technology to `enterprises` and users in India, accelerating AI `innovation` and driving growth across the country". A `formal` `agreement` to `finalise` the project will be signed on Tuesday, the Andhra Pradesh government said. "It is a massive `leap` for our state's digital future, innovation, and global standing," said the state's technology minister Nara Lokesh.

The project will combine cloud and AI infrastructure with renewable energy systems and an expanded `fibre-optic` network. The project is part of the Andhra Pradesh government's plan to develop 6GW of data centre capacity by 2029, according to Bloomberg News. Data centres are physical facilities that `house` the computing and networking `equipment` that organisations use to collect, process, store, and `distribute` data. They contain servers, storage systems and network equipment like routers and firewalls, along with the necessary power and cooling systems to operate them.

In Andhra Pradesh, the government has been offering `subsidised` land and electricity to attract global investors. India's data centre industry has grown rapidly over the past five years, crossing the 1GW capacity mark in 2024 and nearly `tripling` its 2019 level, according to global professional service firm JLL's India Data Centre Market Dynamics 2024 report.

修正與原因：  
1. "says that" → "reports that"：新聞或正式寫作中更自然，比 "says" 正式。  
2. "parentt" → "parent"：拼字錯誤修正。  
3. "invest to build" → "invest in building"：正確用法是 *invest in doing something*。  
4. "a AI" → "an AI"：母音開頭需用 *an*。  
5. "reuseable-energy" → "renewable energy"：正確詞為 *renewable*，意為「可再生」。  
6. 移除 "firewall"：非重點細節，summary 聚焦主題。  
7. "reson" → "reason" / "investement" → "investment" / "raise" → "rise"：三處拼字修正。  
8. "the government there offering the land" → "the government offers subsidized land and electricity"：更自然且保留「補助」細節。  
9. "the raise of internet users" → "the rapid growth of internet users"：*raise* 不作名詞用，應改為 *growth*，並補 *rapid* 使語意完整。  
10. 調整整體句型與語氣，使其符合正式英文風格，更接近托福或新聞摘要格式。
