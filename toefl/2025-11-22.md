Creatures consuming species that contain deadly toxins have evolved a suite of clever strategies to stay alive. The 10 snakes faced a tough predicament. Collected from the Colombian Amazon, they had been without food for several days in captivity and then were presented with extremely unappetising prey: three-striped poison dart frogs, Ameerega trivittata. The skin of those frogs contains deadly toxins – such as histrionicotoxins, pumiliotoxins and decahydroquinolines – that interfere with essential cell proteins. Six of the royal ground snakes (Erythrolamprus reginae) preferred to go hungry. The other four intrepidly slithered in for the kill. But before swallowing their meals, they dragged the frogs across the ground – akin to the way some birds rub toxins off their prey, noted biologist Valeria Ramírez Castañeda of the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleagues, who conducted the experiment. Three of the four snakes survived the meal – suggesting that their bodies were capable of handling the toxins that remained.

Living beings have been wielding deadly molecules to kill each other for hundreds of millions of years. First came microbes that used the chemicals to weed out competitors or attack host cells they were invading; then animals, to kill prey or ward off predators, and plants, to defend against herbivores. In response, many animals have evolved ways to survive these toxins, sometimes even storing them to use against opponents. Scientists are beginning to unravel these creative antitoxin defences and hope as a result to identify better treatments for poisonings in people. More fundamentally, they're learning about a force that has quietly helped to shape biological communities, says evolutionary biologist Rebecca Tarvin of the University of California, Berkeley, who helped supervise the snake experiment and wrote about such strategies in the 2023 Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics. "Just milligrammes of a single compound, and that can change all of the interactions in an ecosystem," Tarvin says.

Species become toxic in a variety of ways. Some of them make the toxins themselves, such as Bufonid toads, which produce molecules called cardiac glycosides that stop a protein called the sodium-potassium pump from shunting ions in and out of cells — a process critical for maintaining cell volume, muscle contraction and nerve impulses. Other animals host toxin-producing bacteria in their bodies, such as pufferfish, whose tetrodotoxin-containing flesh can prove lethal. Many others obtain toxins through food — like poison frogs that devour toxic insects and mites, including the species fed to the ground snakes. As some animals evolved to become toxic, they also rewired their bodies to avoid poisoning themselves. The same thing happened to creatures they eat or that eat them. The best-studied adaptations involve changes to proteins that are normally disabled by toxins, making them resistant. For example, insects feeding on glycoside-rich milkweed plants evolved sodium-potassium pumps that the glycoside cannot bind to. But changing a vital molecule can create complications, says molecular biologist Susanne Dobler of Hamburg University in Germany. In her studies with the large milkweed bug, she found that the more glycoside-resistant the pump becomes, the less efficient it is — a problem especially critical in nerve cells.

The bug seems to have evolved a workaround. In a 2023 study, Dobler’s team found that the most functional pump version, in the brain, is also the most toxin-sensitive one, meaning the bug must have evolved other defences. Dobler suspects that proteins called ABCB transporters — which sit in cell membranes and expel waste or toxins — may play a role. She found that hawk moths use these proteins around their nerve tissues to remove cardiac glycosides, and possibly the milkweed bug does the same. Dobler also hypothesises that many insects have ABCB transporters in their gut membranes, preventing toxins from entering the body. That could explain why the bright red onion beetle, which feeds on glycoside-rich lily of the valley, is unfazed by toxins and simply excretes them — its faeces even repel predatory ants. For the royal ground snakes, the liver seems key. Tarvin’s team found evidence that snake liver extract neutralises toxins from three-striped poison dart frogs. They hypothesise that the snakes have enzymes converting deadly substances into harmless ones, similar to how human bodies detoxify alcohol and nicotine. The liver may also contain “toxin sponge” proteins that bind toxins, preventing them from attaching to targets — similar to proteins found in some poison frogs’ blood that neutralise saxitoxin and alkaloid poisons.

California ground squirrels appear to use a similar trick against rattlesnake venom, which contains dozens of toxins that destroy blood vessels and prevent clotting. Ground squirrel blood has proteins that block some of these toxins, much like rattlesnakes’ own protective proteins. Venom composition differs by region, and evolutionary biologist Matthew Holding of the University of Michigan found that squirrel antivenom is locally adapted. Such defences aren’t foolproof, though. Rattlesnakes constantly evolve new venom to overcome the squirrels’ adaptations — and even they can die from enough of their own venom. That’s why animals, even resistant ones, first try to avoid toxins: hence the snakes’ dragging behaviour, turtles eating only non-toxic parts of newts, or monarch caterpillars draining toxic sap from milkweed before feeding.

Many animals also find ways to safely store toxins they consume and use them for defence. The iridescent dogbane beetle, for example, gathers cardiac glycosides from its host plants and shuttles them to its back via ABCB transporters, releasing defensive droplets when threatened. Some insects even become dependent on host plants for their toxins — like monarch butterflies and milkweed. In a 2021 study, evolutionary biologist Noah Whiteman of UC Berkeley identified four animals that evolved to tolerate cardiac glycosides, allowing them to feed on monarchs, including the black-headed grosbeak, which preys on monarchs in Mexico’s mountain forests. A toxin created in a milkweed on an Ontario prairie, Whiteman notes, has shaped a bird thousands of miles away. "It's just amazing," he says, "the journey travelled by this small molecule, and the influence that it has on evolution."
