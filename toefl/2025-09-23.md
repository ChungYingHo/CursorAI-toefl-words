A global `agreement` designed to protect the world's oceans and reverse damage to marine life is set to become international law. `The High Seas Treaty` received its 60th `ratification` by Morocco on Friday, meaning that it will now take effect from January. `The deal`, which has been two `decades` in the making, will `pave` the way for international waters to be placed into marine protected areas. Environmentalists `heralded` the milestone as a "`monumental` achievement" and evidence that countries can work together for environmental protection.

"Covering more than two-thirds of the ocean, the agreement sets binding rules to conserve and `sustainably` use marine biodiversity," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Decades of overfishing, pollution from shipping and warming oceans from climate change have damaged life below the `surface`. In the latest `assessment` of marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of `extinction`, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Three years ago, countries agreed that 30% of the world's national and international waters — `the high seas` — must be protected by 2030 to help `depleted` marine life `recover`. But protecting the high seas is challenging. No one country controls these waters and all nations have a right to ship and fish there. Currently just 1% of the high seas are protected, leaving marine life at risk of `overexploitation`.

So, in 2023, countries signed the High Seas `Treaty`, `pledging` to put 30% of these waters into Marine Protected Areas. But it was only able to `enter force` if more than 60 nations `ratified` it — meaning they agreed to be legally bound by it. With many nations requiring `parliamentary` approval, `ratification` can often take longer than five years, Elizabeth Wilson, senior director for environmental policy at The Pews Charitable Trust, told the BBC at the UN Oceans Conference earlier this year. She said this was "`record time`". The UK introduced its `bill` for ratification to `Parliament` earlier this month.

Kirsten Schuijt, `director-general` of the World Wide Fund for Nature, `hailed` "a `monumental` achievement for ocean conservation" after the `treaty` `threshold` was reached. She added: "The High Seas Treaty will be a positive `catalyst` for collaboration across international waters and agreements and is a turning point for two-thirds of the world's ocean that lie beyond national `jurisdiction`." Mads Christensen, `executive` director of Greenpeace International, called it "a `landmark` moment" and "proof that countries can come together to protect our blue planet". "The `era` of `exploitation` and destruction must end. Our oceans can't wait and neither can we," he added.

Once the treaty `comes into force`, countries will `propose` areas to be protected, and these will then be voted on by the countries that sign up to the treaty. `Critics` point out that countries will `conduct` their own environmental impact `assessments` and make the final decision — although other countries can `register` `concerns` with `monitoring` bodies.

The ocean is `crucial` for the survival of all organisms on the planet. It is the largest ecosystem, is estimated to contribute $2.5tn (£1.9tn) to world economies, and provides up to 80% of the oxygen we breathe.

1. 被動語態 + 法律生效  
The High Seas Treaty received its 60th ratification by Morocco…  
👉 以此處來說，主詞是條約，但真正執行「批准」動作的是國家（Morocco）。托福常考點：被動語態會隱藏真正的行為者，要能推理出來。

2. 非限定關係子句（補充說明）  
The deal, which has been two decades in the making, will pave the way…  
👉 以此處來說，句子主幹是「The deal will pave the way」。中間的「which has been…」只是補充資訊。托福會考：刪掉修飾語後，你還能不能抓住主幹。

3. 讓步/轉折結構  
But protecting the high seas is challenging.  
👉 以此處來說，前文剛提到「各國同意保護海洋」，這裡卻用 but 強調「實際操作很難」。托福會考：看到轉折訊號詞（but, however, although），就要注意「作者的真正立場」可能藏在後半句。

4. 條件句（生效條件）  
It was only able to enter force if more than 60 nations ratified it.  
👉 以此處來說，條約要「生效」需要一個條件：至少 60 個國家批准。托福會考：if 子句 → 條件 & 限制，常出成細節題。

5. 名詞片語作主語（抽象概念）  
Decades of overfishing, pollution… have damaged life below the surface.  
👉 以此處來說，主詞是一整串「Decades of overfishing, pollution…」，真正的動詞是「have damaged」。托福會考：長主語不要迷路，要能快速定位動詞，找出「誰做了什麼事」。

:::summary
一個守護世界海洋與海洋生物的國際共識將被正式立法成為國際規範，它就是 The High Seas Treaty (公海條約)。  
那在過去，其實很多國家就有共識要守護、甚至反轉人類對海洋以及海洋生物造成的傷害，畢竟海洋受到倒的破壞非常巨大，在最新的調查中，已經有 10% 的海洋生物因為海洋汙染瀕臨絕種。  
但海洋中有相當大的面積是屬於公海，任何國家都沒有權力在公海進行任何活動，因此在維護公海環境上過去收效甚低。  
所以在 2023 年，許多國家簽訂了 The High Seas Treaty，意圖將 30% 的公海那如水資源保護區，這無疑是個巨大的里程碑。  
但這項條約要生效，需要至少 60 個國家同意簽約，也意味著他們願意受到此條約約束。  
而國家也會需要國內立法來協同此條約，所以距離條約的實際執行可能還需要一段時間。  
而屆時條約開始執行，簽訂此條約的國家會透過投票來分配他們的國家需要負責維護的範圍。

1. The High Seas Treaty will become international law after receiving 60 ratifications.  
2. Oceans face severe damage, with 10% of marine species at risk of extinction.  
3. Protecting the high seas is difficult because no country controls them.  
4. In 2023, nations signed the treaty to place 30% of the high seas into protected areas.  
5. The treaty takes effect only after ratification by 60 nations and domestic approval.  
6. Once effective, countries will vote on which areas to protect.
